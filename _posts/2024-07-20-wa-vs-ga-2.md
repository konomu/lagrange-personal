# <a name="flowchart" style="text-decoration: none;">The Flowchart Model

We can broadly categorize prior research findings about the Japanese topic into five main principles. 

1. Exclusive が vs. Contrastive は (三上章 1963, 久野章 1973)
2. Subordinate Clauses vs. Main Clauses (南不二男 1974)
3. Judgment Sentences vs. Phenomenon Sentences (三尾砂 1948)
4. Old Information vs. New Information (松下大三郎 1930) 
5. Specification vs. Supposition (三上章 1953)

Further research into the role of は and が in Japanese syntax structures has made it possible to construct a hierarchy of priorities each of these principles take when it comes to choosing between the two particles. We can use this hierarchy to construct a flowchart, but we'll have to change up these principles so that they play nice with each other.

| Foundational Research →    | New Principles     |
| -------------: | ------------- |
| Exclusive が vs. Contrastive は → | Principle of Emphasis |
| Subordinate Clauses vs. Main Clauses → | Principle of Subordination |
| Judgment Sentences vs. Phenomenon Sentences →<br> Old Information vs. New Information → | Principle of Topic Presence |
| Old Information vs. New Information →<br> Specification vs. Supposition → | Principle of Topic Position |

Here's the resulting flowchart:

![Flowchart](assets/img/flowchart.png)

The names of all of these new principles might sound daunting, but you can actually think of them as simple questions.

| New Principles   | Question     |
| -------------: | ------------- |
| Emphasis → | How is it Emphasized? |
| Subordination → | Can the Clause Have a Topic? |
| Topic Presence → | Is there a Topic? |
| Topic Position → | Which Part is the Topic and Where Is it Placed? |

We'll take a look at the rules that govern these principles in the following sections.

# A Simplified Flowchart

The following flowchart is an heavily simplified version that is adapted from the system above.[^1]

[^1]: It's just a coincidence that these two charts have roughly the same shape. Each node of the simplified chart doesn't correspond to the same node in the full chart.

![Simplified flowchart](assets/img/simple-flowchart.png)

Because of all of the shortcuts we've made here, I can't guarantee that this chart will always lead to the actual usage of は/が. This is partly because it doesn't account for some rules that you'll read about in the next sections, and partly because usage of は/が is **not entirely predictable**. Even in the full flowchart model, this is unavoidable, since it won't always be clear which path to take.

# <a name="emph" style="text-decoration: none;">How is it Emphasized?

The first step of our flowchart is the principle of emphasis. Its purpose is to catch the usages of exclusive が that don't mark any type of subject.

私はケーキセットにしよっと。p253

Exclusive が does not only mark subjects. It can mark certain usages of 「～に」,「～の」, and 「～で」 to make it

Exclusive が can appear in strongly subordinate clauses, but only those that lie on the tense layer (or lower). Thus, <br><span style="color: #ff0040">&nbsp;×「この賞がいちばん賞金が高くなる**まえ**は、応募者が少なかった。」</span><br>is incorrect, but<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;「この賞がいちばん賞金が高かった**とき**は、応募者が少なかった。」<br>is okay.

# <a name="subord" style="text-decoration: none;">Can the Clause Have a Topic?

This principle is also known as the **principle of subordination**. We use this to decide **whether or not the marked element is able to be a topic**.

# <a name="toppres" style="text-decoration: none;">Is There a Topic?

This principle is also known as the **principle of topic presence**. We use this to decide **whether or not the clause/sentence contains a topic**. For the sake of brevity, I'll refer to clauses/sentences without a topic as **topicless sentences**, and clauses/sentences with a topic as **topic sentences** moving forward.

Once we arrive at this stage in the flowchart, the next step is to distinguish topic sentences from topicless sentences. Topicless sentences fit into the「富士山が見えるよ。」structure, and topic sentences fit into all other structures. If we find that a sentence/clause has no topic, we know that it'll always be marked by subject-marking が (sometimes non-topical contrastive は) and never topic-marking は.

There are many different factors to consider at this stage. Let's summarize all of them in a simple table. The cells in bold are cases where the sentence/clause will **always** fall into the category it is under. The cases that aren't in bold will sometimes fall into the other category.

## Topic Sentences

Let's look at the cases where the sentence/clause **must** have a topic. As you can see in our table, the first of these cases is when the **predicate describes a permanent or repetitive state not directly observable to the speaker**. In practice, this means that almost all sentences/clauses with a noun as its predicate will be topic sentences, since most nouns don't imply a temporary state. Predicates that are adjectives like 高い or verbs like すぐれている which don't imply a temporary state also commonly lead to topic sentences. The following example is a topic sentence with an adjective predicate expressing a permanent state.

> バクテリア類生物生態系全体の中で果たしている役割<u>は</u>たいへん重要である。<br>*The role bacteria play in our ecosystem is incredibly important.*

When the predicate expresses some action or temporary state, the sentence might still have a topic if it's some action that someone does **habitually**. 

> ゴリラ<u>は</u>、毎日昼と夜の二回寝床をつくって寝る。<br>*Gorillas build their nests and sleep twice a day, once at noon and once at night.*

The next case which necessitates that the sentence/clause has a topic are those which contain an **interrogative word**. These are words like 誰, どれ, どこ, and 何. When exclusive が marks one of these words, the interrogative word is the comment, and the predicate is the topic.

> 「誰<u>が</u>やったんだと思う？」<br>*"Who do you think did it?"*

Apart from these cases, there are also situations where a topic is more likely to be expressed, but not always necessarily.

- The predicate is a **transitive verb** that expresses someone doing something.

> 陸上競技場の下はでっかい浄水場に⸺ 大阪府水道部<u>は</u>二十三日、こんな新浄水場の建設計画を発表しました。<br>*An enormous water purification plant under the track and field! The Osaka Water Supply Authority announced its plans for such a construction project on the 23rd.*

- The subject/topic is **old information**.

Old information is defined in the following table:

<table class="tg"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0lax">Old information</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">- Anything present at the scene of the conversation.<br>- Anything previously mentioned.<br>- Anything related to something previously mentioned or present at the scene of the conversation.<br>- Anything the listener is aware of.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

>「これ<u>は</u>楽器のお札です。受けとって下さい」と僕は言った。<br>*Here's the money for your instrument. Please accept it," I said.*

>「これ<u>が</u>あのサントス・エルナンデスの、変わり果てた姿かね。」<br>*"So this is what has become of the great Santos Hernandez?"*

The topic in the sentence above is actually the predicate, but it is nonetheless a sentence with a topic.

> パイロットの家庭は、大変なんだ。原因<u>は</u>すべて時差にある。<br>*Being in a pilot's family is tough. It's all because of the time difference.*

> 気象庁<u>は</u>七日、阪神大震災(兵庫県南部地震)の現地調査結果を発表しました。<br>*The Japan Meteorological Agency announced the findings from its investigation into the Great Hanshin earthquake on the 7th.*

It is best not to get into the habit of thinking everything that can be construed as old information should be a topic. We will go over reasons for this in [Misconceptions About New/Old Information](#newold).

- The subject/topic is separated from the predicate by many words (the sentence explains something about some topic).

> 日本公開が間近に迫った「ジュラシック・パーク」<u>は</u>、人気作家マイケル・クライトンのベストセラーの映画化というだけでなく、ダイナミックなビジネス展開でも注目を集めている。<br>*Jurassic Park, scheduled to premiere in Japan soon, isn't just turning heads as a movie adaptation of Michael Crichton's bestselling novel, but also as a bold business decision.*

In contrast, sentences with nothing between the subject and the predicate tend to be topicless.

>最近、「特定の食物」摂取後の運動、あるいは食事内容によらず「食後二時間以内」の運動中に出るショック<u>が</u>注目されている。<br>*As of late, attention has been brought to the dangers associated with exercise after eating certain diet foods, or exercise within two hours of eating regardless of the meal.*

- The sentence follows the structure `Subject` + `Other Case-marked Element` + `Predicate`.

>オムロン<u>は</u>家庭用向け地震警報装置「揺れっ太」を開発、二十日から発売する。<br>*Omron will release its household earthquake warning device "Yuretta" on the 20th.*

## Topicless Sentences

There are two cases where a sentence will always become a topicless sentence. The first one is when **the predicate describes some event or temporary state directly observable to the speaker**. Furthermore, the sentence has to be spoken/narrated **as it's being percieved**. Sentences of this nature usually have verb predicates, such as 見える, 聞こえる, and 来る. Adjective predicates are less common, and noun predicates in topicless sentences are very rare.

> るり子ーッ、 高原さん<u>が</u>いらしたわよーッ」<br>*Ruriko! Takahara is here!*

The other case that necessitates a topicless sentence is when the subject is an indefinite pronoun. This includes words such as 誰か, なにか, and 知らない人.

> 十一時に誰か<u>が</u>やってきた。<br>*Someone came at eleven o'clock.*

Just like we saw with topic sentences, there are cases where a sentence is likely to be topicless, but not always necessarily.

- The predicate is an **intransitive verb** or **passive form of a transitive verb** that expresses something happening.

> 吹田市の万国博記念公園内にある陸上競技場の地下に、大阪府営水道の浄水場を設置すること<u>が</u>二十三日、大阪府と日本万国博覧会記念協会から発表された。<br>*A plan to construct a water purification plant underneath the running track grounds of the Expo Commemorative Park in Suita City was jointly announced by the Prefecture of Osaka and the Commemorative Organization for the Japan World Exposition on the 23rd.*

- The subject is **new information**.

New information is defined in the following table:

<table class="tg"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0lax">New information</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Anything not present at the scene of the conversation, not previously mentioned,  unrelated to anything else previously mentioned or present at the scene of the conversation, and unknown to the listener.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In short, new information is anything that is **not** old information.

> ところが、その翌年、1989年の初夏にパソコン雑誌で「サージョンウイルス」<u>が</u>騒がれだした。<br>*However, that following year in the summer of 1989, several PC magazines published articles about the "Surgeon virus".*

- The sentence describes **something unexpected** happening.

> 奈良平城宮の幹線排水路「東大溝」跡を発掘調査している奈良国立文化財研究所<u>が</u>奈良時代の木彫り面を初めて見つけ、十六日公開した。<br>*The Nara National Institute for Cultural Properties, which has been conducting an excavation at the main drainage channel "East Oomizo" of Heijo Palace, announced on the 16th that they uncovered a carved wooden mask dating back to the Nara Period for the first time.*

- The sentence follows the structure `Other Case-marked Element` + `Subject` + `Predicate`.

> 地震発生時に、震度に合わせて「火を消しなさい」などの音声でとるべき行動を指示する、一般家庭用地震警報器「揺れっ太」を、オムロン<u>が</u>20日から、通信販売ルートを中心に売り出す。<br>*Omron will begin selling "Yuretta," a household earthquake alarm which gives voice instructions to help you act accordingly based on the seismic intensity when an earthquake occurs, mainly through online sales starting from the 20th.*

## <a name="newold" style="text-decoration: none;">Misconceptions About New/Old Information

A common explanation about は/が is that "Important information comes after は and before が." Another common one you might hear is that "は marks old information, and が marks new information."

While these generalizations are true for some sentences, there are many, many sentences for which they don't apply. These rules fail because:

- The concept of new/old information doesn't apply in subordinate clauses
- Old information doesn't strictly appear in topicless sentences.
- Even in topic sentences, you will see exceptions where が marks old information and は marks new information anyways.
- Sometimes, contrastive は doesn't mark old information.

The following is a chart marking the topic, comment, new information, and old information in three of our most important sentence structures. Remember that inverted sentences are also topic sentences.

![Locations of New/Old Information in topic sentences, inverted sentences, and topicless sentences.](assets/img/newoldinfo.jpg)

The two topic sentences fit the generalization that "は marks old information, and が marks new information." However, the topicless sentence isn't so straightforward. The principle of old/new information functions differently in topicless sentences. Assuming the listener knows what Mount Fuji is, we would have to recognize Mount Fuji as "old information". However, it's being marked by が here. This is not an exceptional instance. Instead, we should recognize the **entirety** of the sentence「富士山が見える。」as new information. This makes grammatical sense, as we've already seen such structures convey new information in the ～は～が... structures, and many topicless sentences serve to convey something spontaneous in the moment or to change the subject. 

In future sections, we'll also encounter some examples where が marks old information and は marks new information in topic sentences.

# <a name="toppos" style="text-decoration: none;">Which Part is the Topic?

This principle is also known as the **principle of topic position**. We use this to decide **which part of the clause/sentence is the topic and where we should place it**.

In typical sentences with a topic, the topic is placed at the front of the sentence and the comment is placed after it. Recall back to Part 1 when we saw the topicalization of この本 in the clause 父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと).

> <u>この本</u><b>は</b>父が買ってくれた。

Likewise, we can topicalize the clause この本を買ってくれた in the clause 父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと), and we'll see that it's also placed at the front. This is the same structure as the one we saw for「花が咲くのは7月ごろだ。」

> <u>この本を買ってくれたの</u><b>は</b>父だ。

[Inverting](wa-vs-ga-1/#kimi) this sentence will then give us

> 父<b>が</b><u>この本を買ってくれたのだ</u>。

which is the same structure as「君が主役だ。」

Thus, usage of は/が changes depending on what part of the sentence the topic is in. If the topic is **before** the predicate, it is marked by は. If the topic **is** the predicate, the subject will be marked with exclusive が. From here on, we'll refer to these sentences with the topic in the predicate as **inverted sentences**.

Not all sentences make sense when they're inverted. Before we go over when to use inverted sentences, we should take a look at how to choose what becomes the topic and what becomes the comment.

## Choosing the Topic

The topic is something that you want to talk about, and the comment is something you want to convey about the topic. That means that when choosing what becomes the topic and what becomes the comment, we can follow the general rule that **the comment conveys one option among other options relating to the topic**. 

![Chart explaining the above rule with the example 父がこの本を買ってくれたのだ。](assets/img/topic.jpg)

### Choosing the Topic: Word-level Considerations

There are many rules besides this general one that are useful for choosing the topic and comment. First, we'll take a look at one case which **must** become the comment.

| A noun will always be the comment if it is an:  |
| ------------------- |
| Interrogative Word (e.g. 誰, どれ, どこ, 何)|

This is the reason why you'll almost never see 誰, どれ, どこ, or 何 marked with は. If you do see it with は, it'll always be (non-topical) contrastive は, not topic-marking は.

> だれ<u>は</u>来て、だれ<u>は</u>来なかったの？<br>*Who came, and who didn't?*

### <a name="cslc" style="text-decoration: none;">Choosing the Topic: Sentence-level Considerations

The next set of rules I'll introduce aren't hard-set, but general tendencies of topics in sentences. They can be summarized in the following table:

<table class="tg"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Type of Sentence</th>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Topic</th>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Comment</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky" rowspan="3">Noun Predicate</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Words like 特徴 and 原因</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">The details in question</td>
  </tr>

    <td class="tg-0pky">The values in question</td>

    <td class="tg-0lax">The part that comes earlier in<br>standard word order</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

The rule for sentences with a **noun predicate** are somewhat self-explanatory according to our general rule. They often fit into the「かき料理は広島が本場だ。」structure. Words like 中心, 目的, 基盤, 限度, 値段, 年齢, 名前, and メニュー commonly become the topic, while their content becomes the comment. These are sentences like:

> アジア人の食生活の特徴<u>は</u>、主食があることです。<br>*What's different about Asian diets is the abundance of staple foods.* <br>ー朝日新聞 1993.6.2 新刊 p.16 「食と健康」

> 普通のコースターの所要時間<u>は</u>約3分ほどだ。<br>*Each ride lasts about 3 minutes.*

> このナタデココ<u>は</u>、ココナッツミルクを静かに寝かせて発行させたもの。<br>*This nata de coco is made by fermenting coconut milk.*

「～というものは」is commonly shortened to「～とは」

>炭焼きと<u>は</u>、木材を熱分解して、揮発しやすい成分を可燃性のガスとして燃やしたり、蒸発にして追い出したりした後、炭素が燃えてしまう手前で燃焼を止める作業である。<br>*Sumiyaki is the process of pyrolyzing raw lumber to remove its volatile components to the point just before carbon starts burning away.*

For sentences with **adjective predicates**, we have two different rules. The first one covers adjective sentences that express some kind of comparison, which will often include phrases like「～のほうが (adjective)」and「～がいちばん (adjective)」. In this case, the adjective becomes the topic, and the noun subject is marked with exclusive が.

> 「でも、リカさんと一緒にいる永尾くん<u>が</u>、私の知ってる永尾くんの中で一番元気。」<br>*"Nagao always looks the happiest when I see him with Rika."*

> 「お茶にする、お酒にする？」<br>「お茶<u>が</u>いい」<br>*"Would you like tea or sake?"*<br>*"Tea, please."*

The second rule concerns adjective sentences that express no such comparison. These sentences will likely take the noun subject as its topic, marked by は.

> <ruby>亭主関白<rt>ていしゅかんぱく</rt></ruby>の家<u>は</u>暗い。<br>*Households with domineering husbands are depressing.*

Sentences with **verb predicates** often have multiple case-marked elements. The general rule with verb sentences is that whatever comes earliest in basic sentence order (subject-object-verb) becomes the topic. In this next example, the subject (instead of the object) is the topic because it comes earlier in the SOV order.

> その頃、三郎<u>は</u>刑務所の係長の部屋で<ruby>茶坊主<rt>ちゃぼうず</rt></ruby>をしていた。<br>*At that time, Saburou spent his days at the head of the jail's room, tending to his every need.*

The に case is typically expressed before the subject-marking が case in sentences with predicate ある (as in ～に～がある), so「～に」is topicalized in this next example.

> 「アンチ百恵」としての聖子に<u>は</u>、百恵的エロティシズムを歌わないという宿命がありました。<br>*As the "anti-Momoe", Seiko was destined to never sing with Momoe-esque eroticism.*

### <a name="cclc" style="text-decoration: none;">Choosing the Topic: Context-level Considerations

The concept of **new and old information**, as introduced in [Is There a Topic?](#toppres), is also useful for determining the topic of the sentence. Once again, this isn't a hard-set rule, just a broad tendency sentences with a topic have. 

Recall our definition for new/old information.

<table class="tg"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0lax">Type of Information</th>
    <th class="tg-0lax">Definition</th>
    <th class="tg-0lax">Tends to Be...</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Old Information</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">- Anything present at the scene of the conversation.<br>- Anything previously mentioned.<br>- Anything related to something previously mentioned.<br>- Anything the speaker knows the listener knows about.</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Topic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">New Information</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">- Not old information.</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Comment</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
 
As mentioned in the table, old information tends to be the topic, and new information tends to be the comment. Consider the following examples.

> 俺<u>は</u>中卒さ。<br>*I'm a middle-school graduate.*

> 途中に<ruby>西宮名塩<rt>にしのみやなじお</rt></ruby>がある。同駅<u>は</u>複線電化時に名塩の各住宅団地のために作られた。<br>*Nishinomiya-Najio is on the way there. The station of the same name was built when the line was electrified and double-tracked for the neighborhoods of Najio.*

In the first example, 俺 (I) is topicalized as old information because it refers to the speaker, who is by definition present at the scene of the conversation. It's very common for first and second-person pronouns to be topicalized, because the speaker and the listener are always going to exist in the context of the sentence.

In the second example, 同駅 (the station of the same name) is topicalized because's it's related to 西宮名塩 (Nishinomiya-Najio), a town in Japan which was mentioned in the previous sentence.

Some sentences violate this rule. In this next example, an inverted sentence, old information is marked by exclusive が, making it the comment.

> しかし、天気は、大気の循環というか、気象全体がカオスになっているため、初期条件がほんの少し変わると、天候大異変になってしまう。これ<u>が</u>天気予報の当たらない物理学的な理由である。<br>*Weather isn't a set cycle, but a chaotic system, where even the slightest alteration in starting conditions can cause massive changes in weather. This is why weather forecasts are sometimes off.*

The reason why これ (referring to the previous sentence) is marked with exclusive が is that the noun sentence rule we saw in [Sentence-level Considerations](#slc) is taking precedence over the new/old information rule.

## <a name="specsup" style="text-decoration: none;">How to Tell When Inversion is Possible

In order to find out when it's possible to invert a sentence, we need to look at the meaning of its topic and comment. In topic sentences, the topic is either **referential** or **predicative**. If the topic is referential, the comment is predicative; and if the comment is referential, then the topic is predicative.

| Type of Topic/Predicate | Definition | If Topicalized |
| ---- | ---- |
| Referential | Some individual object/concept | Sentence can't be inverted |
| Predicative | Some aspect/category of <br>the referential element | Sentence can be inverted |

Let's look at a sentence that can't be inverted. Consider the following sentence and its inversion

> ビルの高さは85mです。<br>*The building is 85 meters tall.*

> <span style="color: #ff0040">×85mがビルの高さです。</span>

The topic in these sentences is ビルの高さ, and the comment is "85m". ビルの高さ refers to the concept of the building's height, which is referential in this sentence. "85m" describes the value of the building's height, making it the predicative element of this sentence. In fact, nouns that express some kind of value are almost always predicative. Sentences where the referential element is topicalized can't be inverted, which is why the second sentence sounds awkward.

Now let's go back to our example「君が主役だ。」. In this sentence, 君 is the referential element and 主役 is the predicative element. Since the predicative element is the topic, this sentence can be inverted.

>君が主役だ。<br>主役は君だ。<br>*You're the lead actor.*

If, however, we topicalize the referential element 君, we can no longer invert the sentence.

>君は主役だ。<br>*You're a lead actor.*

><span style="color: #ff0040">×主役が君だ。</span>

In the example「その火事の原因は漏電だ。」the referential element is 漏電 and the predicative element is その火事の原因. We can invert this sentence because the predicative element is topicalized.

>その火事の原因は漏電だ。<br>漏電がその火事の原因だ。<br>*The cause of the fire was an electrical fault.*

It makes little sense to topicalize the referential element here, so neither of the following sentences are natural.

><span style="color: #ff0040">×漏電はその火事の原因だ。<br>×その火事の原因が漏電だ。</span>

Adjectives and verbs are always predicative in this system. In other words, it's almost always possible to use exclusive が when an adjective/verb is the topic.

>いちばんいいのはダイヤだ。<br>ダイヤがいちばんいい。<br>*Diamonds are the best.*

## When to Use Inverted Sentences

When it comes to inversion, there are three types of sentences:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Sentences that can't be inverted sentences</li>
  <li>Sentences that are sometimes inverted sentences</li>
  <li>Sentences that are often inverted sentences</li>
</ol> 

We just learned how to identify sentences that can't be inverted (a). Now, let's go over sentences in type (b) and (c).

| Sometimes Inverted Sentences | Often Inverted Sentences |
| ---- |
| - Sentences with a noun topic<br>- Sentences with a verb topic (nominalized or not)<br>- Sentences in which the comments are the details of topics like「特徴」or「原因」  | - Sentences with an adjective topic (nominalized or not)<br>- Sentences in which the comment is old information<br>- Sentences in which the comment is an interrogative word |

Our 「その火事の原因は漏電だ。」 example falls into type (b), because it has a noun topic, and the comment express the details of the topic 原因. You are more likely to see「その火事の原因は漏電だ。」than the inversion「漏電がその火事の原因だ。」

The following example also falls into type (b), because it has a verb topic (nominalized).

> そう言ったのは山田だ。<br>*Yamada said that.*

You are more likely to see「そう言ったのは山田だ。」than the inversion「山田がそう言ったのだ。」

In the following dialogue, the second sentence is type (c). 

> 「バリバリしゃぶりついてるじゃないの、いつもは。」<br>「そう、しゃぶりつくの<u>が</u>、本当は一番おいしいんだよ。」<br>*"Why do you always suck on it like that?"<br>"It tastes better when you suck on it."*

Although its topic is a nominalized adjective, the sentence is expressed as an inverted sentence because its topic is nonetheless derived from an adjective. The last example in the previous section,「ダイヤがいちばんいい。」is also more commonly expressed as an inverted sentence because its topic is an adjective.

> これがそばの実です。<br>*This is buckwheat grain.*

Here, the comment これ refers to old information.[^2] You're more likely to see this inverted sentence than 「そばの実はこれです。」

[^2]: This sentence violates the principle of topicalizing old information, like the last example in [Choosing the Topic: Context-level Considerations](#cclc)

Sometimes, you'll have conflicting principles in the same sentence.

> 結局どちらが勝ったんですか？<br>*So, who won in the end?*

This one has a nominalized verb predicate, but it also has an interrogative word as its comment. Here, the princple of the interrogative word is taking presence, making it an inverted sentence of type (c). The uninverted「結局勝ったのはどちらですか？」is also possible, but less common.
