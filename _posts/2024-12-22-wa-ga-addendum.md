Since writing [は and が: An In-Depth Guide](wa-ga-basics), I've come to realize that there are some usages of が that are difficult to explain with the typology given by Noda (野田 1996). Technically, his sentence typology covers the sentences I will explain in this article, but they function distinctly from typical sentences you will see in their given categories. So I believe they deserve their own descriptions. I've never seen any of these sentence forms described in English-language Japanese-learning resources (save for a mention of enumeration in Kuno's **The Structure of the Japanese Language**). All information that follows comes from 今田 (2010).

We will look at four sentence forms, all of which are topicless noun sentences, and all of which contain が. 

# Neutral-Description Noun Sentences (中立叙述型名詞述語文)

The "neutral-description sentences" are probably most strongly related to the typical topicless sentence structure as described by Noda. The term "neutral-description" refers to a usage of が that doesn't impart any special emphasis and it is mostly **equivalent to the [subject-marking が](wa-ga-basics#subj-ga)** I introduced in the main guide. Thus, the verb and adjective sentences given as examples of topicless sentences by Noda can also be called neutral-description sentences. But in this section, I will specifically be focusing on neutral-description **noun** sentences, as these are much rarer than their adjective or verb counterparts. 

I have yet to find an explanation of why noun sentences using neutral-description が are uncommon. Indeed, when we use が in a noun sentence with no further context, the interpretation of the sentence which uses exclusive が is usually the one the speaker means. 

>1\. 私が田中です。(Exclusive が)<br>***I** am Tanaka.*

>2\. ? 私が田中です。(Neutral-description が)<br>*? Look, I am Tanaka!*

Consider example 1, a noun sentence using exclusive が. We can imagine that this is a sentence spoken by Tanaka in response to someone asking "Who in this group is Tanaka?" Tanaka is specifying that **he** is Tanaka. This is the natural interpretation.

But if we were to interpret the same sentence using neutral-description が, as in example 2, it comes across as awkward. In [The Principle of Topic Presence](wa-ga-topic-presence), I explained the conditions under which a sentence is likey to be expressed as a topicless sentence (i.e. use neutral-description が). One of those conditions was that "a temporary state directly observable to the speaker, expressed at that moment," was being conveyed. Neutral-description が imparts a nuance that the sentence is describing some event, or something the speaker is percieving. Thus, this interpretation is unnatural unless we imagine a fantastical situation where the speaker has magically assumed Tanaka's body and is pointing it out (or something similar).

Nevertheless, neutral-description noun sentences are grammatical and will sound natural if the context allows for it. The following examples (3-9) all use neutral-description が.

>3\. あっ、<u>家が</u>ドーム型だ！<br>*Woah, the house is dome-shaped!*

>4\. あっ、<u>イチローが</u>四番打者だ！<br>*Hey look, Ichirou's batting fourth!*

>5\. <u>信号が</u>赤だ。<br>*The traffic light's red.*

Examples 3 to 5 are neutral-description noun sentences where what is being described is directly perceptible to the speaker. But as outlined in the introductory section on [Topicless Sentences](wa-ga-basics/topicless-sentences) in the main guide, there are other categories of topicless sentences which don't describe perceptible events/states. 


>6\. 日本チームの負けは濃厚だ。<u>主力選手が</u>ベンチウォーマーだ。<br>*The Japanese team is on the verge of defeat. Their best guy's on the bench.*

>7\. <u>上司が</u>あいつですよ。やる気が出ませんよ、まったく。<br>*My boss is that guy. I can't stand it.*

>8\. 彼女を信頼して全てをまかせたのだが、<u>これが</u>とんだペテン師だった。<br>*I put my trust in her and left it all in her hands, but she turned out to be a crook.*

>9\. 友人を家に泊めた。ところがその<u>男が</u>大酒のみだ。飲み始めたら止まらない。<br>*I let my friend stay at my house. But it turns out, he was a drunkard. Once he started drinking, he wouldn't stop.*

>10\. と、その時、ぼくの右手の下の布地が動く、ハッとした。ひょっとすると、<u>席の布地だとばかり思っていたところが</u>、彼女の。まさか。やっぱりそうだった。彼女のスカートだった。<br>*At that moment, the fabric under my right hand shifted, and I gasped. I thought I had my hand on the fabric of the seat... it couldn't be. But it was... my hand was on her skirt.*

Example 6 and 7 are neutral-description noun sentences which don't describe directly perceptible states, but temporary states occurring in the present. 

Examples 8 to 10 are neutral-description noun sentences which function like a description of a temporary state or event as experienced by the speaker. These examples are of recounted stories (events that happened in the past), so they demonstrate that neutral-description が isn't only used in statements narrated in the moment.
