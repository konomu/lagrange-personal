This is where I keep my personal website. It's Jekyll-generated and uses modified version of the [Lagrange theme by Paul Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange). Everything is still under construction for now. I'm working on adding more blog posts.

TODO:

- Add font support for Japanese text.
- Figure out the domain thing
- add comments
- add favicon

Possible articles:

- が vs. は
- pyaa
- personal japanese learning
