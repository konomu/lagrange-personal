# <a name="flowchart" style="text-decoration: none;">The Flowchart Model

We can broadly categorize prior research findings about the Japanese topic into five main principles. 

1. Exclusive が vs. Contrastive は (三上章 1963, 久野章 1973)
2. Subordinate Clauses vs. Main Clauses (南不二男 1974)
3. Judgment Sentences vs. Phenomenon Sentences (三尾砂 1948)
4. Old Information vs. New Information (松下大三郎 1930) 
5. Specification vs. Supposition (三上章 1953)

Further research into the role of は and が in Japanese syntax structures has made it possible to construct a hierarchy of priorities each of these principles take when it comes to choosing between the two particles. We can use this hierarchy to construct a flowchart, but we'll have to change up these principles so that they play nice with each other.

| Foundational Research →    | New Principles     |
| -------------: | ------------- |
| Exclusive が vs. Contrastive は → | Principle of Emphasis |
| Subordinate Clauses vs. Main Clauses → | Principle of Subordination |
| Judgment Sentences vs. Phenomenon Sentences →<br> Old Information vs. New Information → | Principle of Topic Presence |
| Old Information vs. New Information →<br> Specification vs. Supposition → | Principle of Topic Position |

Here's the resulting flowchart:

![Flowchart](assets/img/flowchart.png)

The names of all of these new principles might sound daunting, but you can actually think of them as simple questions.

| New Principles   | Question     |
| -------------: | ------------- |
| Emphasis → | How is it Emphasized? |
| Subordination → | Can the Clause Have a Topic? |
| Topic Presence → | Is there a Topic? |
| Topic Position → | Which Part is the Topic and Where Is it Placed? |

We'll take a look at the rules that govern these principles in the following sections.

# A Simplified Flowchart

The following flowchart is an heavily simplified version that is adapted from the system above.[^1]

[^1]: It's just a coincidence that these two charts have roughly the same shape. Each node of the simplified chart doesn't correspond to the same node in the full chart.

![Simplified flowchart](assets/img/simple-flowchart.png)

Because of all of the shortcuts we've made here, I can't guarantee that this chart will always lead to the actual usage of は/が. This is partly because it doesn't account for some rules that you'll read about in the next sections, and partly because usage of は/が is **not entirely predictable**. Even in the full flowchart model, this is unavoidable, since it won't always be clear which path to take.

# <a name="emph" style="text-decoration: none;">How is it Emphasized?

The first step of our flowchart is the **principle of emphasis**. Its purpose is to catch the **usages of contrastive は and exclusive が that don't mark any type of subject or topic**. But in this section, we will discuss all sorts of usages of contrastive は and exclusive が.

It's possible to view both は and が as a spectrum. On the **spectrum of は**, we have topic-marking は on one end, and contrastive は on the other end. On the **spectrum of が**, we have subject-marking が on one end, and exclusive が on the other. Between topic-marking は and subject-marking が, we have a **spectrum of topicality**, indicating how topical the word is. Between contrastive は and exclusive が, we have a **spectrum of emphasis**, indicating how the word is emphasized.

![Spectra of は and が](assets/img/spectra.jpg)

The idea behind this model is that the two usages of は and the two usages of が we've introduced are not separate from each other. Every usage of は or が falls somewhere on the spectrum.

Generally speaking, there are three categories of は.

<ol type="a">
  <li>Topic-marking は with no contrastive nuance</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p><u>この本は</u>父が買ってくれた。<br><em>My dad bought this book for me.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>Contrastive は which marks a topic</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p><u>兄は</u>肉が好きだが、<u>弟は</u>魚が好きだ。<br><em>My brother likes meat, but my younger brother likes fish.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>Contrastive は which marks a non-topic</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p>私は<u>肉は</u>好きだが、<u>魚は</u>好きではない。<br><em>I like meat, but I don't like fish.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</ol> 



In the flowchart, "contrastive は" refers to (c), while "topical contrastive は" refers to (b). 

The same idea can be roughly applied to が.

<ol type="a" start="4">
  <li>Subject-marking が with no exclusive nuance</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p><u>富士山が</u>見えるよ。<br><em>I can see Mount Fuji.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>Exclusive が which marks a subject</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p><u>君が</u>主役だ。<br><em>You're the lead actor.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>Exclusive が which subjectivises a non-subject</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p><u>六本木のディスコが</u>芸能人がよく来る。<br><em>Celebrities come to the discotheques in Roppongi often.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</ol> 

There is a crucial difference between (c) and (f) here. が has not fully evolved as an emphasis marker, so there is no usage where exclusive が is fully removed from its subject-marking function, unlike は, which can be fully removed from its topic-marking function. Some instances of exclusive が mark adverbs, clauses, or cases other than the subject, but this is only true for those that have subject-like character. Thus, when exclusive が marks a non-subject, we may interpret that non-subject as having become a subject, a process known as **subjectivisation** (Kuno 1973). In the flowchart, **subjectivising exclusive が** refers to (f). [^2] The "exclusive が" that appears after the Principle of Topic Position refers to (e).

[^2]: In the simplified flowchart, all usages of は with contrastive nuance (b and c) are labeled contrastive は, and all usages of が with exclusive nuance (e and f) are labeled exclusive が.

## Types of Contrast

All usages of contrastive は have one of two forms of contrast: **explicit** or **implicit**.

||Definition|
|--|--|
|Explicit Contrast|What's being contrasted against is explicitly mentioned.|
|Implicit Contrast|What's being contrasted against is not mentioned, only implied.|

## Explicit Contrast

Explicit contrast occurs when two explicit things are being contrasted.

> 子供たちはカレー<u>は</u>作っているが、ごはん<u>は</u>まだ炊いていない。<br>*The kids are making curry, but the rice is not even cooked yet.*

It often appears with multiple contrastive は, but it is possible with just one contrastive は as well. 

><u>形は</u>いいが、色が悪い。<br>*It has a nice shape, but that color is horrendous.*

Explicit contrast can be further divided into two types: **opposite** or **adjacent**. 

||Definition|
|--|--|
|Opposite Contrast|Shows that the state of one contrasted element is opposite to the state of another contrasted element.|
|Adjacent Contrast|Shows that the state of one contrasted element is different from the state of another contrasted element.|

In the following examples, (1) shows opposite contrast, and (2) shows adjacent contrast.

>私は<u>肉は</u>好きだが、<u>魚は</u>好きではない。<br>*I like eating meat, but I don't like fish.*

>私は<u>肉は</u>スーパーで買い、<u>魚は</u>市場で買う。<br>*I buy meat at the supermarket, but I buy fish at the street market.*

In sentences with opposite contrast, the predicates (in this case, 好き and 好きではない) of the contrasted elements are usually positive and negative forms of the same predicate, or predicates with opposite meanings. In sentences with adjacent contrast, the predicates (in this case, both 買う) are similar, but express some subtle difference. Opposite contrast is more common than adjacent contrast.

These usages of contrastive は are often connected with 〜が or 〜けど clauses. 

Both of these sentences show contrastive は marking objects, while the topic of the sentence is 私. Thus, all four of these usages are **non-topical** contrastive は. Generally speaking, non-topical contrastive は is more common in sentences with opposite contrast than it is in ones with adjacent contrast.



### Misfortunate Contrast

This is a relatively minor usage of contrastive は that appears when something with negative connotations are being described. It is often followed by statements such as ｢困ったことだ｣, or ｢いけないことだ｣.

><u>家は</u>取られ、<u>妻には</u>逃げられた。<br>*They took my house, and my wife left me.<br>*

>｢<u>出席日数は</u>足りないし、レポートも提出していないし、受験も受けていない。｣<br>*"My attendence is too low, I never turned in a report, and I didn't even take the final."*

### More Examples of Explicit Contrast

>サブは<u>ゴルフは</u>やるが、<u>生活は</u>派手ではない。<br>*Sahb plays golf, but doesn't live a flashy life.*

>｢<u>風は</u>冷たいけど、ええ天気や。｣<br>*"The wind is cold, but it's nice out."*

Although there is only one instance of contrastive は in the sentence above, it still has explicit contrast, because 風は冷たい and ええ天気 are approximately opposite in meaning. They are being explicitly contrasted.

><u>雨は</u>降っているが、<u>雪は</u>降っていない。<br>*It's raining, but not snowing.*

>私たちは<u>数十秒間イキを止めていることは</u>できますが、<u>心臓を止めておくことは</u>できません。<br>*We can hold our breaths for just under a minute, but we can't stop our heartbeat.*

>みりんは、<u>魚には</u>煮崩れを防いで味をしめるため最初に入れ、<u>野菜には</u>ツヤを出し、やわらかくするため最後に入れる、というのも大切なポイントだ。<br>*Mirin should be added first to the fish so that it keeps its flavor and doesn't fall apart during boiling, and afterwards to the vegetables for softness, and to give them a nice finish.*

## Implicit Contrast

Implicit contrast occurs when something being contrasted against isn't explicitly mentioned, only implied.

> 子供たちはカレー<u>は</u>作っている。<br>*The kids are making curry, but...*

In the example above, even though the making of curry is not explicitly being compared against some other thing, the contrastive は here implies that there is some other thing that has not been cooked yet.

Implicit contrastive は can be identified through the following properties.

|Implicit contrastive は tends to..|
|--|
| - Appear closer to the predicate <br> - Mark objects, 〜に elements, or adverbs, less often subjects <br> - Mark a noun with a counterpart that is easy to contrast with <br> - Be pronounced with a higher pitch along with what it marks |

The more of these properties a sentence has, the stronger its contrastive nuance becomes. Consider the following examples:

>私は<u>その質問には</u>答えられません。<br>その質問には<u>私は</u>答えられません。<br>*I cannot answer that question.*

When there are two or more elements in a sentence marked by は, the one closer to the predicate takes on a more contrastive nuance. This happens because the emphasized portion of the sentence when contrastive は appears is not just the element marked by contrastive は, but also all of the content after the element until the end of its predicate. It is easier to pick up on contrastive nuance if the emphasized portion is uninterrupted. 

Thus, in the first example above, it's easy to interpret that the speaker is clarifying that he cannot answer **that question** specifically. In the second example, it's easy to interpret that the speaker is clarifying that **he**, specifically, cannot answer the question.

However, you may notice that in the first example, the more contrastive は marks a 〜に element, while in the second example, the more contrastive は marks a subject. As a result, it is possible to interpret that there is almost no contrastive nuance in the second example, but it's incredibly difficult to interpret that there is no contrastive nuance in the first example.

### More Examples of Implicit Contrast

>こうしたなかで、<u>子宮がんだけは</u>年々確実に減っていく。<br>*Amidst all this, uterine cancer is the only cancer that is steadily decreasing year by year.*

>私は<u>みかんは</u>好きだ。<br>*I do enjoy oranges.*

>子供たちはキャンプファイヤーはしなかった。<br>*The kids didn't light a campfire.*


### Contrastive は in Negative Statements

Implicit contrastive は is extremely common when the predicate is negative. These are predicates that end in ～じゃない, ～ていない, ～くない, ～ではない, ～じゃなくて, ～ません, ～ず, etc. For example, if we were to make the statement ## negative, we would likely have to add contrastive は.

>日本の老人はシャワーでがまんできる。<br>*The elderly of Japan can tolerate showering.*

> 日本の老人は<u>シャワーでは</u>がまんできん。<br>*The elderly of Japan can't stand showering.*       - 朝日新聞 1993.3.3 新刊 p.5 ｢老いの園｣

The reasoning for this is that a positive predicate is assumed to be the default state. When something is expressed to go against that default, we are **implicitly contrasting** it with some other thing with the predicate's positive state. If we were to explicitly contrast the example above with this positive state, it would be something like the following.

> 日本の老人は入浴なら週2回でもがまんできるけど、<u>シャワーでは</u>がまんできん。<br>*The elderly of Japan can tolerate bathing maybe twice a week, but they can't stand showering.* 

However, we are not always strongly conscious of this implicitly contrasted state, and with some negative statements, it's not easy to imagine such contrast. 

> 人間の麻薬には中毒がつきものだが、猫のマタタビには<u>中毒は</u>ない。<br>*Human drugs are addictive, but cats won't get addicted to catnip.*

In the example above, there is explicit contrast between 人間の麻薬には and 猫のマタタビには. However, it's hard to imagine some explicit state that can be contrasted with 中毒は.

Thus, when contrastive は is used with negative statements, the nuance of contrast is often weaker than that of positive statements, or completely absent, as is the case in ##. 

You may also be familiar with the set phrase ではない/ではありません. The は in this phrase is also thought to be implicit contrastive は, but it has almost entirely lost its contrastive nuance.

### Negative Statements without Contrastive は

Some statements will not contain contrastive は even when it is negative. Such cases are listed below.

|Cases Where Negative Statements Don't Contain Contrastive は |
|--|
| - The inflected negative ending (e.g. 〜ない, 〜ません) of the predicate is strongly bound to its stem. <br> - The negative predicate is strongly bound to its subject. |

The two following examples are cases where the inflected ending is strongly bound to its stem.

> <b>杉矢、ボー然としている。</b><br><b>杉矢</b>｢...<u>ホタルが</u>いない...｣<br>*<b>*Sugiya stares into the distance*</b><br><b>Sugiya:</b> "There aren't any fireflies..."*

> ウイルスのプログラムは、単に行動形態がウイルスに似ているから、そう名付けられているだけで、あらかじめプログラムの上で決められた行動をする以外の何者でもない。そして、自然界に存在するウイルスと違って、人間が作ったものだということである。<u>こと点が</u>、意外と知られていない。<br>*Computer viruses are named so simply because their behavior resembles that of a virus, but they are nothing more than programs that carry out predetermined actions. And unlike viruses that exist in nature, these viruses are man-made. Surprisingly, many people don't seem to realize this.*

"##" is a topicless sentence, while ## is an inverted topic sentence. The ない the predicate いる in ## has a negating effect on the entirety of the word いない, but unlike in negative statements with contrastive は, this effect does not extend to other words. いない may be viewed as one component separate from all other phrases, similarly to the word 不在. 

Look at the structure of ｢日本の老人はシャワーではがまんできない。｣

> ```日本の老人``` + ```は``` + (```シャワーでがまんできる``` + ```ない```)

The contrastive は is added as a result of ない acting upon the portion シャワーで. The structure of ## is instead

> ```ホタル``` + ```が``` + (```いる``` + ```ない```)

"##" also follows the same principle, where contrastive は does not appear because ない is strongly bound to the predicate 知られている. However, が is used here because この点 is the comment of the sentence. More details on the difference between topicless sentences and inverted topic sentences will be discussed in [Is There a Topic?](#toppres)

The second case listed in the table, where the negative predicate is strongly bound to its subject, covers sentences like ##

> 野上は、学生の頃から、<u>女がいないことが</u>なかった...それも、いつも複数で...<br>*Nogami's never been without a girl, ever since we were students... and it's always been at least two at the same time...*

The portion 女がいない takes が because it's a strongly subordinate clause (see [Can the Clause Have a Topic?](#subord)). The が after こと, however, is present because it belongs to the set phrase ことがない. Usually, you can tell that something is a set phrase if it appears as one entry in a dictionary. If it appears with が, it is less likely to be expressed with contrastive は.

## Types of Words Contrastive は Can Mark

Generally speaking, contrastive は can attach to all case markers (〜が, 〜を, 〜に, 〜で, 〜へ, 〜と, 〜から, 〜より, and 〜まで).

> きょうはパン屋へは行かなかった。<br>*Today, I didn't go to the bread store.*

However, contrastive は cannot attach to the following cases:

|Contrastive は usually does NOT attach to|
|--|
|- 〜で expressing means (電車で), material (木で), or cause (かぜで)<br> - 〜から expressing cause (不手際から) |

The following examples are ungrammatical, because contrastive は are attaching to words marked by で expressing means and cause.

><span style="color: #ff0040"> ×きょうは<u>電車では</u>来なかった。</span>

><span style="color: #ff0040"> ×きょうは<u>かぜでは</u>休まなかった。</span>

If the speaker is mentioning some condition instead of a matter of fact, however, then it is possible for contrastive は to attach to these cases. 

>頂上までは、<u>車では</u>行けない。<br>*You can't get to the peak with a car.*

>あいつは、<u>ちょっとしたかぜでは</u>休まない。<br>*He wouldn't take the day off just because of a cold.*

Now, let's take a look at adverbs that can be marked by contrastive は.

|Adverb Expresses...|Examples|Markable by は?|
|--|--|--|
| Manner | そっと, あっさり | × (○) |
| Extent | たいへん, 非常に | × |
| Aspect | もう, だんだん | × | 
| Tense | きのう, その時まで | ○ | 
| Mood | きっと, ぜひ | × | 
| Quantity | 3人, 100円, ちょっと | ○ | 

><span style="color: #ff0040"> ×これは<u>たいへんは</u>面白くない。</span>

><span style="color: #ff0040"> ×<u>もうは</u>着いていないと思う。</span>

><u>お昼ごろまでは</u>家にいた。<br>*I was at home until noon.*

><span style="color: #ff0040"> ×<u>きっとは</u>来ないと思う。</span>

><u>二百本は</u>売れない。<br>*Two hundred copies is too much for me to sell.*

><u>全部は</u>食べなかった。<br>*I didn't eat all of it.*

Generally speaking, the only adverbs that can be marked by は are ones that express tense or a quantity of something. In some cases, contrastive は can mark adverbs that express manner, but only when mentioning some condition instead of a matter of fact, similarly to ##.

><span style="color: #ff0040"> ×<u>そっとは</u>手渡さなかった。</span>

><u>そっとは</u>手渡せない。<br>*We can't hand it over without putting up a fight.*

Contrastive は may also mark 〜て appearing as successive phrases (See [Successive Phrases](#successive-phrases)).

>かすかな音を立てて降りそそぐ雨が、<u>睡蓮の葉に似た輪を描いては</u>消えて行く。<br>*The rain falls with a soft sound, making circles on the water like lily leaves.*

Contrastive は may also mark conditional clauses. When it marks 〜たら, 〜(れ)ば, or 〜と, the clause ending must change into 〜ては. When it marks 〜なら, the clause ending must change into 〜のでは.

>甘いものを食べても太らない人もいますし、<u>そんな子が無理に甘いものをガマンしてノイローゼになっては</u>、元も子もありません。<br>*There are people who don't gain weight even if they eat sweets, so I think it's counterproductive for her to resist them so hard if it just stresses her out.*

Finally, contrastive は may appear within a predicate. 聞いてはくれた, 愛しはする, おいしくはある, 雨ではある are all examples of this case.

>女性は凡庸さに近いものを<u>愛しは</u>しますが、それだけのことです。<br>*Women love mediocre things sometimes, that's all.*

>また、日本IBM製のパソコンでも、日本語モードを使っていれば<u>感染は</u>するが<u>発病は</u>しないのである。<br>*Using a computer from IBM Japan with a Japanese locale will not stop the virus from infecting your computer, but it will prevent it from delivering its payload.*

## Types of Exclusion

All forms of exclusive が can have one of two forms of exclusion: strong or weak.

||Definition|
|--|--|
|Strong Exclusion|One option is picked out of a pool of other options to be marked by exclusive が, and those other options are apparent.|
|Weak Exclusion|One option is picked out of a pool of other options to be marked by exclusive が, but those other options are not apparent.|

While strong exclusion may be indicated by subjectivising exclusive が or exclusive が marking a subject, weak exclusion may only be indicated by exclusive が marking a subject.

### Strong Exclusion

Strong exclusion often takes the form of 〜のほうが... or 〜がいちばん... because these phrases directly imply the existence of other options that can be marked by exclusive が. The nuance of strongly exclusive が is that we are expressing a clear comparison between one thing marked by exclusive が versus some other thing(s).

> 神戸より大阪のほうがにぎやかだ。<br>*Osaka is a much more livelier place than Kobe.*

> あれも嫌い、これも嫌い、と否定を表明しつづける人より、<u>あれも好き、これも好き、と肯定を表明しつづける人のほうが</u>、なにごとによらず喜びは多い。<br>*People who are vocal about the things they love will always be more happy than people who are vocal about the things they hate.*

> 一度帰ったら、なかなか出てこられないことは、<u>桃子が</u>一番よく知ってるでしょう？<br>*Out of all of us, Momoko knows better than anyone how hard it is to leave home after coming back.*

### Weak Exclusion

With weak exclusion, whatever is marked by exclusive が is still being singled out, but no clear comparison is drawn between it and some other thing(s).

> <u>君が</u>主役だ。<br>*You're the lead actor.*

> <u>一人ひとり違っているお客様の味を的確に読みとって、お好みどおりの飲み物を作って差し上げるのが</u>私たちバーテンダーの仕事なんですよ。<br>*Our job as bartenders is to pick up on the subtleties of our customers' preferences, and to make and serve drinks that they will enjoy.*

The two examples above are both inverted topic sentences (See [Which Part is the Topic?](#toppos)). Sentences with weak exclusion will almost always be inverted topic sentences, but inverted topic sentences will also often exhibit strong exclusion.

Another case where weak exclusion appears is in commands where the subject is explicitly stated. It's rare for the subject be mentioned in commands, so when it is, it's likely because the speaker is specifying who should carry out the command, adding exclusive nuance.

> ｢どいて｣<br>と、桃子は、良介のショッピングカーをつついた。<br>｢<u>そっちが</u>どけや｣<br>*"Move," said Momoko, nudging Ryosuke's shopping cart.<br>"You move."*

## Types of Words Exclusive が Can Mark

We already know that exclusive が can mark a subject, but there also exists another form of exclusive が called **subjectivising exclusive が** that may mark non-subjects, turning them into subjects.

Unlike contrastive は, the set of case-marked words that subjectivising exclusive が can mark is much more limited. Also, when が marks these cases, the original case marker is deleted and replaced with が.

|Exclusive が can usually replace|
|--|
|- 〜の expressing possession <br> - 〜に expressing time, location, or direction <br> - 〜で expressing location |

"##" is an example where 〜の expressing possession has been replaced by subjectivising exclusive が.

>だが、現在はまだ<u>北の高気圧の方が</u>勢力が強い。<br>*For the time being, the high-pressure system in the north is still the most severe.*

"##" is an example where 〜に expressing location has been replaced by subjectivising exclusive が.

>広島は<u><ruby><rb>流川</rb><rt>ながれかわ</rt></ruby>あたりが</u>バーや飲屋がおおいが、広島駅のすぐそばの駅西の路地で飲んだ。<br>*In Hiroshima, there are many bars and drinking establishments around Nagarekawa, but we drank in an alley shop at Ekinishi, which is very close to Hiroshima Station.*

"##" is an example where 〜に expressing direction has been replaced by subjectivising exclusive が.

><u>六本木のディスコが</u>芸能人がよく来る。<br>*Celebrities come to the discotheques in Roppongi often.*

"##" is an example where 〜で expressing location has been replaced by subjectivising exclusive が.

><u>この店が</u>つけで買物できる。<br>*You can shop on credit here.*

The set of adverbs that subjectivising exclusive が can mark is also narrower than that of contrastive は. Generally, only adverbs that express **tense**, such as 今 or ことし, may be marked.

>洗濯屋さんは<u>いまが</u>一年で一番忙しい。<br>*The cleaners are at their busiest at this time of year.*


# <a name="subord" style="text-decoration: none;">Can the Clause Have a Topic?

This principle is also known as the **principle of subordination**. We use this to decide **whether the clause the marked word is in can hold a topic**.

A clause in Japanese is a unit of the language which is **shorter than a sentence** and **longer than its words or phrases**. In its most typical form, each clause in Japanese contains a **subject and a predicate**. It may also contain other words/phrases marked by case markers like を, に, or で; as well as adverbs. You will also come across clauses where the subject isn't explicitly present. Omitting the subject is much more common in Japanese than it is in English.

When a sentence has two or more clauses, the clause with its predicate at the end of the sentence is usually the **main clause**. All clauses that are nested within it or come before it are **subordinate clauses**.[^3] If a sentence only has one clause, then that clause is the main clause. Take a look at the following sentences with their clauses highlighted.

[^3]: It's also possible for subordinate clauses to be nested within subordinate clauses. In the image, I use the convention that weakly subordinate clauses are not nested within the main clause; while quotations, strongly subordinate clauses and fully subordinate clauses are. Sentences are from 丸山 (2016) and 劉 (2022).

![Various structures of subordinate clauses](assets/img/subord.jpg)

Sometimes, a subordinate clause without a subject will take the subject of the main clause. This is the case for the fifth sentence of the examples above (the subject of 読みながら is お父さん).

## The Subject in Subordinate Clauses

The method for choosing は vs. が in the main clause is generally the same one used in sentences with one clause. We will go over this in future sections. For now, let's focus on how to use these particles in subordinate clauses.

There's a general rule that when は marks a subject at the start of a sentence with multiple clauses, it usually marks the subject of all of the clauses. が, on the other hand, usually only marks the subject within its own clause. In other words, whatever は marks is relevant to everything until the end of the sentence, while whatever が marks stays in its own clause. 

This general rule works because **が is most commonly used in subordinate clauses**.

Consider the following sentences (庵功雄, 2012).

>太郎<u>は</u>部屋に入ると、すぐに電気をつけた。<br>太郎<u>が</u>部屋に入ると、すぐに電気をつけた。

Highlighting the clauses gives us the following diagram.

![太郎は部屋に入ると、すぐに電気をつけた。and 太郎が部屋に入ると、すぐに電気をつけた。](assets/img/subord1.jpg)

Here are the correct interpretations of these sentences. 

>太郎<u>は</u>部屋に入ると、すぐに電気をつけた。<br>*As soon as Tarou entered the room, <b><u>he</u></b> turned on the light.*

>太郎<u>が</u>部屋に入ると、すぐに電気をつけた。<br>*As soon as Tarou entered the room, <b><u>I</u></b> turned on the light.*

We change our interpretation of who turns on the light depending on whether は or が is used. In the first example with は, the subject/topic 太郎 **can't** be a part of the subordinate clause 部屋に入ると. This is only possible when 太郎 is not a topic and marked by が. 

Thus, in the first example 太郎 is seen as the subject of both the subordinate clause and the main clause. In the second example, 太郎 is only seen as the subject of the subordinate clause. The subject of the main clause is instead omitted, so it should be clear through context **who else** turned the light on. Strictly speaking, it doesn't have to be "I", the speaker, who turned the light on. It could be someone else in the context of the sentence. But when Japanese speakers omit a subject, they're commonly referring to themselves.

The subordinate clause in the last two examples can't contain a topic. But this isn't true of all subordinate clauses. This subordinate clause in particular is **strongly subordinate**, which means it has a high level of subordination to the main clause. 

## Levels of Subordination

There are four **levels of subordination**, described in the following table.

||Description|
|:--:|--|--|
|Full Subordination | This portion of the sentence can't contain any topics or subjects at all, so they are actually phrases, not clauses. |
|Strong Subordination | The subordinate clause is completely dependent on the main clause. It can contain a subject, but not a topic. |
|Weak Subordination | The subordinate clause functions like a separate sentence, but still makes up one sentence with the main clause. It can contain a subject or a topic. Rules for choosing between は/が are generally the same as that for the main clause. |
|Quotative | The subordinate clause is a quote. It can contain a subject or a topic. Rules for choosing between は/が are generally the same as that for the main clause.|

We can usually figure out a subordinate clause's level of subordination by looking at how it ends. The chart below gives common examples of subordinate clauses, as well as its level of subordination and whether that clause is able to contain subject-marking が and topic-marking は.

><span style="color: #ff96ed">[彼が帰って、]</span>会は面白くなった。<br>*After he left, the party got interesting.*

〜から, 〜ので, and 〜のに clauses are strongly subordinate (only take が) if the information expressed in them is the focus of the sentence. In other words, the subject should be marked with が if the information in these clauses is important or unknown to the listener. This is common in sentences answering questions with どうして and なぜ, as well as in sentences where the clause is the comment of a topic sentence (as in 〜は〜からだ。)

>「じゃ、どうして桃子に渡したりするのよ! どうして直接会いにこないのよ!」<br>「<span style="color: #ff96ed">[貞<u>が</u>、あなとのこと好きみたいだったから、]</span>なんか会いづらくなって...」<br>*"Then why would you hand it to Momoko!? Why wouldn't you meet me face-to-face!?"*<br>*"Because Sada liked you, and it felt wrong to meet you..."*

> なぜ猫には、こんなに派手に変化する瞳孔があるのだろう。それは、<span style="color: #ff96ed">[猫<u>が</u>優れた夜のハンターだから]</span>だ。<br>*Why do cats' pupils narrow and widen like so? It is because they are top-notch night hunters.*

〜から, 〜ので, and 〜のに clauses are weakly subordinate (may take は or が) if it does not have this function. The method for choosing between は or が is the same as it is for the main clause (which will be covered in future chapters).

><span style="color: #ff96ed">[この本は面白いので、]</span>読んでみてください。<br>*This book is very interesting, so please read it.*

><span style="color: #ff96ed">[田中さんはパーティーに来たのに、]</span>林さんは来なかった。<br>*Tanaka came to the party, but Hayashi didn't.*

### Parallel Clauses (並列節)

><span style="color: #ff96ed">[兄は銀行に入って、]</span>姉は大学に残った。<br>*My brother went into banking, and my sister stayed in college.*

><span style="color: #ff96ed">[おじいさんは山へ行き、]</span>おばあさんは川へ行った。<br>*The old man went into the mountains, and the old woman went to the river.*

><span style="color: #ff96ed">[これまでがそうだったし、]</span>これからもそうなのだろう。<br>*It has always been that way, and it will always be that way.*

><span style="color: #ff96ed">[顔が真っ赤になってるけど、]</span>どうしたの？<br>*Your face is all red, what happened?*

><span style="color: #ff96ed">[東京は震災前から大都市として変貌しつつあったが、]</span>震災復興がそれに一挙に加速した。<br>*Tokyo was already transforming as a major city before the disaster, but the process of rebuilding the city following the earthquake has accelerated that transformation dramatically.*

Contrastive は is common in 〜が and 〜けど clauses.

>一般労働者の意識調査によれば、<span style="color: #ff96ed">["政党離れ"は進んでいるが、]</span>政党への関心は決して低くない。<br>*According to the survey of general workers, respondants increasingly report no affiliation to any party, but interest in political parties has remained steady.*

### Quotative Clauses (引用節)

>私は、<span style="color: #ff96ed">[あなたは誰の料理が一番食べたいと]</span>聞かれたら、私の料理と答える。<br>*When I'm asked whose cuisine I'd rather eat, I always answer, "my own."*

><span style="color: #ff96ed">[今度は誰だって]</span>思ったけど、知らない女の子だった。<br>*I thought, "Who is it this time?" but it was a girl I'd never seen before.*

Quotative Clauses generally follow the same rules as that of the main clause for choosing between は and が, but when applying a negated sense to a quotative clause (like in 「〜とは思わなかった」,「〜なんて信じられない」,「〜とでも言うのか」), が is commonly used, even when は would normally appear.

>「あの子は真面目な子なの。」<br>「<span style="color: #ff96ed">[俺が不真面目だって]</span>言うのかい？」<br>*"She's a serious girl."*<br>*"Are you saying I'm not serious?"* 


# <a name="toppres" style="text-decoration: none;">Is There a Topic?

This principle is also known as the **principle of topic presence**. We use this to decide **whether or not the clause/sentence contains a topic**. For the sake of brevity, I'll refer to clauses/sentences without a topic as **topicless sentences**, and clauses/sentences with a topic as **topic sentences** moving forward.

Once we arrive at this stage in the flowchart, the next step is to distinguish topic sentences from topicless sentences. Topicless sentences fit into the「富士山が見えるよ。」structure, and topic sentences fit into all other structures. If we find that a sentence/clause has no topic, we know that it'll always be marked by subject-marking が (sometimes non-topical contrastive は) and never topic-marking は.

There are many different factors to consider at this stage. Let's summarize all of them in a simple table. The cells in bold are cases where the sentence/clause will **always** fall into the category it is under. The cases that aren't in bold will sometimes fall into the other category.

## Topic Sentences

Let's look at the cases where the sentence/clause **must** have a topic. As you can see in our table, the first of these cases is when the **predicate describes a permanent or repetitive state not directly observable to the speaker**. In practice, this means that almost all sentences/clauses with a noun as its predicate will be topic sentences, since most nouns don't imply a temporary state. Predicates that are adjectives like 高い or verbs like すぐれている which don't imply a temporary state also commonly lead to topic sentences. The following example is a topic sentence with an adjective predicate expressing a permanent state.

> バクテリア類が生物生態系全体の中で果たしている役割<u>は</u>たいへん重要である。<br>*The role bacteria play in our ecosystem is incredibly important.*

When the predicate expresses some action or temporary state, the sentence might still have a topic if it's some action that someone does **habitually**. 

> ゴリラ<u>は</u>、毎日昼と夜の二回寝床をつくって寝る。<br>*Gorillas build their nests and sleep twice a day, once at noon and once at night.*

The next case which necessitates that the sentence/clause has a topic are those which contain an **interrogative word**. These are words like 誰, どれ, どこ, and 何. When exclusive が marks one of these words, the interrogative word is the comment, and the predicate is the topic.

> 「誰<u>が</u>やったんだと思う？」<br>*"Who do you think did it?"*

Apart from these cases, there are also situations where a topic is more likely to be expressed, but not always necessarily.

- The predicate is a **transitive verb** that expresses someone doing something.

> 陸上競技場の下はでっかい浄水場に⸺ 大阪府水道部<u>は</u>二十三日、こんな新浄水場の建設計画を発表しました。<br>*An enormous water purification plant under the track and field! The Osaka Water Supply Authority announced its plans for such a construction project on the 23rd.*

- The subject/topic is **old information**.

Old information is defined in the following table:

<table class="tg"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0lax">Old information</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">- Anything present at the scene of the conversation.<br>- Anything previously mentioned.<br>- Anything related to something previously mentioned or present at the scene of the conversation.<br>- Anything the listener is aware of.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

>「これ<u>は</u>楽器のお札です。受けとって下さい」と僕は言った。<br>*Here's the money for your instrument. Please accept it," I said.*

>「これ<u>が</u>あのサントス・エルナンデスの、変わり果てた姿かね。」<br>*"So this is what has become of the great Santos Hernandez?"*

The topic in the sentence above is actually the predicate, but it is nonetheless a sentence with a topic.

> パイロットの家庭は、大変なんだ。原因<u>は</u>すべて時差にある。<br>*Being in a pilot's family is tough. It's all because of the time difference.*

> 気象庁<u>は</u>七日、阪神大震災(兵庫県南部地震)の現地調査結果を発表しました。<br>*The Japan Meteorological Agency announced the findings from its investigation into the Great Hanshin earthquake on the 7th.*

It is best not to get into the habit of thinking everything that can be construed as old information should be a topic. We will go over reasons for this in [Misconceptions About New/Old Information](#newold).

- The subject/topic is separated from the predicate by many words (the sentence explains something about some topic).

> 日本公開が間近に迫った「ジュラシック・パーク」<u>は</u>、人気作家マイケル・クライトンのベストセラーの映画化というだけでなく、ダイナミックなビジネス展開でも注目を集めている。<br>*Jurassic Park, scheduled to premiere in Japan soon, isn't just turning heads as a movie adaptation of Michael Crichton's bestselling novel, but also as a bold business decision.*

In contrast, sentences with nothing between the subject and the predicate tend to be topicless.

>最近、「特定の食物」摂取後の運動、あるいは食事内容によらず「食後二時間以内」の運動中に出るショック<u>が</u>注目されている。<br>*As of late, attention has been brought to the dangers associated with exercise after eating certain diet foods, or exercise within two hours of eating regardless of the meal.*

- The sentence follows the structure `Subject` + `Other Case-marked Element` + `Predicate`.

>オムロン<u>は</u>家庭用向け地震警報装置「揺れっ太」を開発、二十日から発売する。<br>*Omron will release its household earthquake warning device "Yuretta" on the 20th.*

## Topicless Sentences

There are two cases where a sentence will always become a topicless sentence. The first one is when **the predicate describes some event or temporary state directly observable to the speaker**. Furthermore, the sentence has to be spoken/narrated **as it's being percieved**. Sentences of this nature usually have verb predicates, such as 見える, 聞こえる, and 来る. Adjective predicates are less common, and noun predicates in topicless sentences are very rare.

> るり子ーッ、 高原さん<u>が</u>いらしたわよーッ」<br>*Ruriko! Takahara is here!*

The other case that necessitates a topicless sentence is when the subject is an indefinite pronoun. This includes words such as 誰か, なにか, and 知らない人.

> 十一時に誰か<u>が</u>やってきた。<br>*Someone came at eleven o'clock.*

Just like we saw with topic sentences, there are cases where a sentence is likely to be topicless, but not always necessarily.

- The predicate is an **intransitive verb** or **passive form of a transitive verb** that expresses something happening.

> 吹田市の万国博記念公園内にある陸上競技場の地下に、大阪府営水道の浄水場を設置すること<u>が</u>二十三日、大阪府と日本万国博覧会記念協会から発表された。<br>*A plan to construct a water purification plant underneath the running track grounds of the Expo Commemorative Park in Suita City was jointly announced by the Prefecture of Osaka and the Commemorative Organization for the Japan World Exposition on the 23rd.*

- The subject is **new information**.

New information is defined in the following table:

<table class="tg"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0lax">New information</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Anything not present at the scene of the conversation, not previously mentioned,  unrelated to anything else previously mentioned or present at the scene of the conversation, and unknown to the listener.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In short, new information is anything that is **not** old information.

> ところが、その翌年、1989年の初夏にパソコン雑誌で「サージョンウイルス」<u>が</u>騒がれだした。<br>*However, that following year in the summer of 1989, several PC magazines published articles about the "Surgeon virus".*

- The sentence describes **something unexpected** happening.

> 奈良平城宮の幹線排水路「東大溝」跡を発掘調査している奈良国立文化財研究所<u>が</u>奈良時代の木彫り面を初めて見つけ、十六日公開した。<br>*The Nara National Institute for Cultural Properties, which has been conducting an excavation at the main drainage channel "East Oomizo" of Heijo Palace, announced on the 16th that they uncovered a carved wooden mask dating back to the Nara Period for the first time.*

- The sentence follows the structure `Other Case-marked Element` + `Subject` + `Predicate`.

> 地震発生時に、震度に合わせて「火を消しなさい」などの音声でとるべき行動を指示する、一般家庭用地震警報器「揺れっ太」を、オムロン<u>が</u>20日から、通信販売ルートを中心に売り出す。<br>*Omron will begin selling "Yuretta," a household earthquake alarm which gives voice instructions to help you act accordingly based on the seismic intensity when an earthquake occurs, mainly through online sales starting from the 20th.*

## <a name="newold" style="text-decoration: none;">Misconceptions About New/Old Information

A common explanation about は/が is that "Important information comes after は and before が." Another common one you might hear is that "は marks old information, and が marks new information."

While these generalizations are true for some sentences, there are many, many sentences for which they don't apply. These rules fail because:

- The concept of new/old information doesn't apply in subordinate clauses
- Old information doesn't strictly appear in topicless sentences.
- Even in topic sentences, you will see exceptions where が marks old information anyways.
- Sometimes, contrastive は doesn't mark old information.

The following is a chart marking the topic, comment, new information, and old information in three of our most important sentence structures. Remember that inverted sentences are also topic sentences.

![Locations of New/Old Information in topic sentences, inverted sentences, and topicless sentences.](assets/img/newoldinfo.jpg)

The two topic sentences fit the generalization that "は marks old information, and が marks new information." However, the topicless sentence isn't so straightforward. The principle of old/new information functions differently in topicless sentences. Assuming the listener knows what Mount Fuji is, we would have to recognize Mount Fuji as "old information". However, it's being marked by が here. This is not an exceptional instance. Instead, we should recognize the **entirety** of the sentence「富士山が見える。」as new information. This makes grammatical sense, as we've already seen such structures convey new information in the ～は～が... structures, and many topicless sentences serve to convey something spontaneous in the moment or to change the subject. 

In future sections, we'll also encounter some examples where が marks old information in topic sentences.

# <a name="toppos" style="text-decoration: none;">Which Part is the Topic?

This principle is also known as the **principle of topic position**. We use this to decide **which part of the clause/sentence is the topic and where we should place it**.

In typical sentences with a topic, the topic is placed at the front of the sentence and the comment is placed after it. Recall back to Part 1 when we saw the topicalization of この本 in the clause 父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと).

> <u>この本</u><b>は</b>父が買ってくれた。

Likewise, we can topicalize the clause この本を買ってくれた in the clause 父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと), and we'll see that it's also placed at the front. This is the same structure as the one we saw for「花が咲くのは7月ごろだ。」

> <u>この本を買ってくれたの</u><b>は</b>父だ。

[Inverting](wa-vs-ga-1/#kimi) this sentence will then give us

> 父<b>が</b><u>この本を買ってくれたのだ</u>。

which is the same structure as「君が主役だ。」

Thus, usage of は/が changes depending on what part of the sentence the topic is in. If the topic is **before** the predicate, it is marked by は. If the topic **is** the predicate, the subject will be marked with exclusive が. From here on, we'll refer to these sentences with the topic in the predicate as **inverted sentences**.

Not all sentences make sense when they're inverted. Before we go over when to use inverted sentences, we should take a look at how to choose what becomes the topic and what becomes the comment.

## Choosing the Topic

The topic is something that you want to talk about, and the comment is something you want to convey about the topic. That means that when choosing what becomes the topic and what becomes the comment, we can follow the general rule that **the comment conveys one option among other options relating to the topic**. 

![Chart explaining the above rule with the example 父がこの本を買ってくれたのだ。](assets/img/topic.jpg)

### Choosing the Topic: Word-level Considerations

There are many rules besides this general one that are useful for choosing the topic and comment. First, we'll take a look at one case which **must** become the comment.

| A noun will always be the comment if it is an:  |
| ------------------- |
| Interrogative Word (e.g. 誰, どれ, どこ, 何)|

This is the reason why you'll almost never see 誰, どれ, どこ, or 何 marked with は. If you do see it with は, it'll always be (non-topical) contrastive は, not topic-marking は.

> だれ<u>は</u>来て、だれ<u>は</u>来なかったの？<br>*Who came, and who didn't?*

### <a name="cslc" style="text-decoration: none;">Choosing the Topic: Sentence-level Considerations

The next set of rules I'll introduce aren't hard-set, but general tendencies of topics in sentences. They can be summarized in the following table:

<table class="tg"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center;" class="tg-0pky"></th>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Topic</th>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Comment</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;" class="tg-0pky" rowspan="3">Noun Predicate</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Words like 特徴 and 原因</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">The details in question</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Words like 高さ and 色</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">The values in question</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">「～というもの」</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">The explanation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td class="tg-0pky">The adjective predicate</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">The noun subject</td>

    <td class="tg-0lax">The part that comes earlier in<br>standard word order</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

The rule for sentences with a **noun predicate** are somewhat self-explanatory according to our general rule. They often fit into the「かき料理は広島が本場だ。」structure. Words like 中心, 目的, 基盤, 限度, 値段, 年齢, 名前, and メニュー commonly become the topic, while their content becomes the comment. These are sentences like:

> アジア人の食生活の特徴<u>は</u>、主食があることです。<br>*What's different about Asian diets is the abundance of staple foods.* <br>ー朝日新聞 1993.6.2 新刊 p.16 「食と健康」

> 普通のコースターの所要時間<u>は</u>約3分ほどだ。<br>*Each ride lasts about 3 minutes.*

> このナタデココ<u>は</u>、ココナッツミルクを静かに寝かせて発行させたもの。<br>*This nata de coco is made by fermenting coconut milk.*

「～というものは」is commonly shortened to「～とは」

>炭焼きと<u>は</u>、木材を熱分解して、揮発しやすい成分を可燃性のガスとして燃やしたり、蒸発にして追い出したりした後、炭素が燃えてしまう手前で燃焼を止める作業である。<br>*Sumiyaki is the process of pyrolyzing raw lumber to remove its volatile components to the point just before carbon starts burning away.*

For sentences with **adjective predicates**, we have two different rules. The first one covers adjective sentences that express some kind of comparison, which will often include phrases like「～のほうが (adjective)」and「～がいちばん (adjective)」. In this case, the adjective becomes the topic, and the noun subject is marked with exclusive が.

> 「でも、リカさんと一緒にいる永尾くん<u>が</u>、私の知ってる永尾くんの中で一番元気。」<br>*"Nagao always looks the happiest when I see him with Rika."*

> 「お茶にする、お酒にする？」<br>「お茶<u>が</u>いい」<br>*"Would you like tea or sake?"*<br>*"Tea, please."*

The second rule concerns adjective sentences that express no such comparison. These sentences will likely take the noun subject as its topic, marked by は.

> <ruby>亭主関白<rt>ていしゅかんぱく</rt></ruby>の家<u>は</u>暗い。<br>*Households with domineering husbands are depressing.*

Sentences with **verb predicates** often have multiple case-marked elements. The general rule with verb sentences is that whatever comes earliest in basic sentence order (subject-object-verb) becomes the topic. In this next example, the subject (instead of the object) is the topic because it comes earlier in the SOV order.

> その頃、三郎<u>は</u>刑務所の係長の部屋で<ruby>茶坊主<rt>ちゃぼうず</rt></ruby>をしていた。<br>*At that time, Saburou spent his days at the head of the jail's room, tending to his every need.*

The に case is typically expressed before the subject-marking が case in sentences with predicate ある (as in ～に～がある), so「～に」is topicalized in this next example.

> 「アンチ百恵」としての聖子に<u>は</u>、百恵的エロティシズムを歌わないという宿命がありました。<br>*As the "anti-Momoe", Seiko was destined to never sing with Momoe-esque eroticism.*

### <a name="cclc" style="text-decoration: none;">Choosing the Topic: Context-level Considerations

The concept of **new and old information**, as introduced in [Is There a Topic?](#toppres), is also useful for determining the topic of the sentence. Once again, this isn't a hard-set rule, just a broad tendency sentences with a topic have. 

Recall our definition for new/old information.

<table class="tg"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center;" class="tg-0lax"></th>
    <th class="tg-0lax">Definition</th>
    <th class="tg-0lax">Tends to Be...</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;" class="tg-0lax">Old Information</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">- Anything present at the scene of the conversation.<br>- Anything previously mentioned.<br>- Anything related to something previously mentioned.<br>- Anything the speaker knows the listener knows about.</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Topic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;" class="tg-0lax">New Information</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">- Not old information.</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Comment</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
 
As mentioned in the table, old information tends to be the topic, and new information tends to be the comment. Consider the following examples.

> 俺<u>は</u>中卒さ。<br>*I'm a middle-school graduate.*

> 途中に<ruby>西宮名塩<rt>にしのみやなじお</rt></ruby>がある。同駅<u>は</u>複線電化時に名塩の各住宅団地のために作られた。<br>*Nishinomiya-Najio is on the way there. The station of the same name was built when the line was electrified and double-tracked for the neighborhoods of Najio.*

In the first example, 俺 (I) is topicalized as old information because it refers to the speaker, who is by definition present at the scene of the conversation. It's very common for first and second-person pronouns to be topicalized, because the speaker and the listener are always going to exist in the context of the sentence.

In the second example, 同駅 (the station of the same name) is topicalized because's it's related to 西宮名塩 (Nishinomiya-Najio), a town which was mentioned in the previous sentence.

Some sentences violate this rule. In this next example, an inverted sentence, old information is marked by exclusive が, making it the comment.

> しかし、天気は、大気の循環というか、気象全体がカオスになっているため、初期条件がほんの少し変わると、天候大異変になってしまう。これ<u>が</u>天気予報の当たらない物理学的な理由である。<br>*Weather isn't a set cycle, but a chaotic system, where even the slightest alteration in starting conditions can cause massive changes in weather. This is why weather forecasts are sometimes off.*

The reason why これ (referring to the previous sentence) is marked with exclusive が is that the noun sentence rule we saw in [Sentence-level Considerations](#slc) is taking precedence over the new/old information rule.

## <a name="specsup" style="text-decoration: none;">How to Tell When Inversion is Possible

In order to find out when it's possible to invert a sentence, we need to look at the meaning of its topic and comment. In topic sentences, the topic is either **referential** or **predicative**. If the topic is referential, the comment is predicative; and if the comment is referential, then the topic is predicative.

|  | Definition | If Topicalized |
| :----: | ---- |
| Referential | Some individual object/concept | Sentence can't be inverted |
| Predicative | Some aspect/category of <br>the referential element | Sentence can be inverted |

Let's look at a sentence that can't be inverted. Consider the following sentence and its inversion

> ビルの高さは85mです。<br>*The building is 85 meters tall.*

> <span style="color: #ff0040">×85mがビルの高さです。</span>

The topic in these sentences is ビルの高さ, and the comment is "85m". ビルの高さ refers to the concept of the building's height, which is referential in this sentence. "85m" describes the value of the building's height, making it the predicative element of this sentence. In fact, nouns that express some kind of quantity are almost always predicative. **Sentences where the referential element is topicalized can't be inverted**, which is why the second sentence sounds awkward.

Now let's go back to our example「君が主役だ。」. In this sentence, 君 is the referential element and 主役 is the predicative element. Since the predicative element is the topic, this sentence can be inverted.

>君が主役だ。<br>主役は君だ。<br>*You're the lead actor.*

If, however, we topicalize the referential element 君, we can no longer invert the sentence.

>君は主役だ。<br>*You're a lead actor.*

><span style="color: #ff0040">×主役が君だ。</span>

In the example「その火事の原因は漏電だ。」the referential element is 漏電 and the predicative element is その火事の原因. We can invert this sentence because the predicative element is topicalized.

>その火事の原因は漏電だ。<br>漏電がその火事の原因だ。<br>*The cause of the fire was an electrical fault.*

It makes little sense to topicalize the referential element here, so neither of the following sentences are natural.

><span style="color: #ff0040">×漏電はその火事の原因だ。<br>×その火事の原因が漏電だ。</span>

Adjectives and verbs are always predicative in this system. In other words, it's almost always possible to use exclusive が when an adjective/verb is the topic.

>いちばんいいのはダイヤだ。<br>ダイヤがいちばんいい。<br>*Diamonds are the best.*

## When to Use Inverted Sentences

When it comes to inversion, there are three types of sentences:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Sentences that can't be inverted sentences</li>
  <li>Sentences that are sometimes inverted sentences</li>
  <li>Sentences that are often inverted sentences</li>
</ol> 

We just learned how to identify sentences that can't be inverted (a). Now, let's go over sentences in type (b) and (c).

| Sometimes Inverted Sentences | Often Inverted Sentences |
| ---- |
| - Sentences with a noun topic<br>- Sentences with a verb topic (nominalized or not)<br>- Sentences in which the comments are the details of topics like「特徴」or「原因」  | - Sentences with an adjective topic (nominalized or not)<br>- Sentences in which the comment is old information<br>- Sentences in which the comment is an interrogative word |

Our 「その火事の原因は漏電だ。」 example falls into type (b), because it has a noun topic, and the comment express the details of the topic 原因. You are more likely to see「その火事の原因は漏電だ。」than the inversion「漏電がその火事の原因だ。」

The following example also falls into type (b), because it has a verb topic (nominalized).

> そう言ったのは山田だ。<br>*Yamada said that.*

You are more likely to see「そう言ったのは山田だ。」than the inversion「山田がそう言ったのだ。」

In the following dialogue, the second sentence is type (c). 

> 「バリバリしゃぶりついてるじゃないの、いつもは。」<br>「そう、しゃぶりつくの<u>が</u>、本当は一番おいしいんだよ。」<br>*"Why do you always suck on it like that?"<br>"It tastes better when you suck on it."*

Although its topic is a nominalized adjective, the sentence is expressed as an inverted sentence because its topic is nonetheless derived from an adjective. The last example in the previous section,「ダイヤがいちばんいい。」is also more commonly expressed as an inverted sentence because its topic is an adjective.

> これがそばの実です。<br>*This is buckwheat grain.*

Here, the comment これ refers to old information.[^4] You're more likely to see this inverted sentence than 「そばの実はこれです。」

[^4]: This sentence violates the principle of topicalizing old information, like the last example in [Choosing the Topic: Context-level Considerations](#cclc)

Sometimes, you'll have conflicting principles in the same sentence.

> 結局どちらが勝ったんですか？<br>*So, who won in the end?*

This one has a nominalized verb predicate, but it also has an interrogative word as its comment. Here, the princple of the interrogative word is taking presence, making it an inverted sentence of type (c). The uninverted「結局勝ったのはどちらですか？」is also possible, but less common.
