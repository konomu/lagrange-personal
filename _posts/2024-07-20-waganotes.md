However, exclusive が is used here because "この点" (this detail) is the comment of the sentence. More details about the difference between topicless sentences and specificational sentences will be discussed in [Principle of Topic Presence](wa-ga-topic-presence).

Another important thing to note about the ｢象は鼻が長い。｣ structure is that it's very common for the comment to express a **state** or **quality** of the topic instead of an **action**.

Usually, we may use subject-marking が in topicless sentences when the subject is being introduced to the listener, something unexpected happens, or to change the topic. 

>52\. <u>一人ひとり違っているお客様の味を的確に読みとって、お好みどおりの飲み物を作って差し上げるのが</u>私たちバーテンダーの仕事なんですよ。<br>*Our job as bartenders is to pick up on the subtleties of our customers' preferences, and to make and serve drinks that they will enjoy.*

>28\. <u>大阪と京都の境から次第に川幅を広げ、堂々と街を横切りつつ大阪湾に流れ込むのが</u>淀川だ。広々とした河川敷の野草広場には天然記念物のイタセンパラやアユモドキなどの魚をはじめ、多くの野生生物が生息。<br>*The Yodo River gradually widens from the border between Osaka and Kyoto, cutting across cities before flowing into Osaka Bay. The spacious riverbed is home to many wildlife species, including fish such as the deepbody bitterling and the kissing loach, which are designated as natural monuments.*

Sometimes, this structure can be used even if there is little exclusive nuance, as in (28). It is used in this case so that the topic, "淀川" (Yodo River) can be placed towards the end, closer to its following sentences which also take "淀川" as a topic.

# [は and が: An In-Depth Guide](https://konomu.github.io/wa-ga-basics)

This is my writing, but most material is from 『｢は｣ と ｢が｣』by Hisashi Noda. I believe it is probably the most comprehensive learner-oriented explanations of the Japanese topic system in English to date. I found that there was a lack of English resources on this subject that could accurately and adequately explain its intricacies, so this is an attempt to provide an accessible and easily digestible resource. There are 7 chapters of content, built around a flowchart model and prototypical sentences structures in Japanese. Feedback is appreciated.


## Subordinate Sentences

-- Some sentences express a high level of subordination to some other sentence, and thus are only able to take が. They generally fall into three types.

a) Causal (〜からだ and 〜ためだ)
b) Explanatory (〜のだ and 〜わけだ)
c) Denying Possibility (〜わけがない and 〜はずがない)

Maybe not lmao
Notes: 

- Situations where what precedes ga is not the sentence's emphasis
 - When the entire sentence is emphasized (ganzen)
 - When the entire sentence is emphasized (not ganzen)
 - When the predicate is emphasized
- The focus of the sentence when ha is used is always in the predicate.
- The focus of the sentence when ga is used can be before ga, after ga, or the entire sentence.
- The presupposition of sentences with focus after ga is always a contrastive presupposition.
 - This is also true for sentences with focus before ga.
- Presupposition in sentences with ha aren't necessarily contrasted with other presuppositions.

が has an exceptional usage that takes precedent over all other rules that I will describe in this article. You may have also seen this form of が referred to before as exhaustive-listing が, or exhaustive が.

Sometimes, が can be used where は is normally used in order to **emphasize the subject**. With this particular usage of が, the subject that が marks is singled out from a pool of other possible subjects. Consider the following two sentences.

 - Watashi は Tarou desu.

 - Watashi が Tarou desu.
 
The first sentence is a declaration of what the speaker's name is. Tarou may say this to answer the question, "What is your name?" when he's meeting someone new.

The second sentence specifies that the speaker is Tarou. Tarou may say this to answer the question, "Who here is Tarou?"

Exclusive が can always be 

You will learn more about exclusive が when we introduce the 「君が主役だ。」 structure.


Just like exclusive ga, contrastive は is an exceptional usage that takes precedent over all other rules going forward.

When the speaker brings up a subject in order to compare an attribute of that subject with that of other possible subjects, they may use contrastive wa.

Ame は hutteimasu ga, yuki は hutteimasen

Contrastive は commonly appears with negated verbs.


# Nominal Sentences

A sentence with a noun as its predicate is a nominal sentence. Most nominal sentences use は to mark its subject/topic. Think of は as the default particle to mark the subject/topic in nominal sentences. Nominal sentences will always have a topic, which will either be present in the sentence or only implied through context.

//

There are several reasons が might be used instead of は to mark the subject in nominal sentences. One reason is exclusive ga, when the subject is singled out from other possible subjects.

## Exclusive が and New/Old Information

Depending on the context of the sentence, there may have already been a topic established previously in the discourse. In a typical nominal sentence, the topic is "old information," and the predicate is "new information". 

To clearly define new information and old information:
 - Old information is known to the listener. It can be something present at the scene of the conversation, something previously mentioned in the text, or something the speaker knows the listener knows about.
 - New information is unknown to the listener.
 
 To illustrate this concept clearly, it's easiest to use an example. Imagine that a teacher has asked you the following question:

Nihon no syuto ha doko desu ka?

The most straightforward way of answering this question would be to replace doko with Tokyo. We can answer like so:

Nihon no syuto ha Tokyo desu.

Notice how the topic/subject (nihon no syuto) is marked with は. It's the old information in this sentence, because at the time of answering our teacher's question, we know that our teacher is asking about Japan's capital. The information that is presumably unknown to our teacher, and which we must answer with (Tokyo) is the new information.
 
There is, however, another way to answer the question:

Tokyo が nihon no syuto desu.

Now the new information comes first in our sentence. Notice that it is marked with exclusive ga. The nuance of this sentence is that we are specifying that Tokyo is the capital of Japan.

So what's happened to the topic of our sentence? Since there's no は, does this mean that this answer doesn't have a topic?

No. The topic of this sentence is the same as it was in our first answer: nihon no syuto. It's just that now, the topic is the predicate of the sentence and isn't marked with wa. When the topic is inside of the sentence, but not marked with wa, it's called an unmarked topic (indai).

### Inversion

From the last example, we can generalize that by reversing the order of the topic and the predicate in a typical nominal sentence, we can express the predicate as the new subject and our topic as the new predicate of the sentence. But we must mark the new information with exclusive ga. In other words:

A は B da = B が A da

This process is called inversion. We've inverted the sentence by switching the places of the old and new information.

Inversion doesn't work with all sentences, though. We call sentences where inversion doesn't work "supposition sentences," (soteibun) and sentences where inversion works "specification sentences" (shitei bun). The sentence we just looked at is a specification sentence. The following is an example of a supposition sentence:

Inu は doubutu da.

Let's try inverting this sentence just like we did with the last example.

× Doubutu が inu da.

This sentence is ungrammatical. 

Why can some sentences be inverted, and others can't? The answer lies in the semantic meaning of the topic and the predicate. 

 - A sentence where the topic and the predicate refer to the same thing is a specification sentence.
 - A sentence where the topic and the predicate do not refer to the same thing is a supposition sentence.

## Implied Topic (Ryakudaibun) in Nominal Sentences

Another reason why a nominal sentence might use が instead of は is because the topic is not actually in the sentence, but implied through context. Consider the sentences:

Hi が tettekita. Kumo が kireta no da.

The second sentence is a nominal sentence because of the nominalizer no. A learner might mistakenly parse the sentence like so:

× (Kumo) <subject が (kireta no) <noun predicate da.

This is wrong because the predicate of the sentence is not kireta no. No is not just nominalizing kireta, it's nominalizing the entirety of kumo が kireta. The correct way to parse this sentence is:

((Kumo) <subject が kireta no) <noun predicate da.

The topic of the sentence is implied by the previous sentence. The text first brings up the fact that the sun has started to shine. The fact that the sun has started to shine is now old information and it can become the topic. It would be natural to follow up with the reason why the sun has started to shine.

Hi が tettekita. (Sore ha) <implied topic Kumo が kireta kara(no) da.

Notice that this usage of が does not necessarily imply that Kumo is especially new or important information compared to the rest of the sentence. Compared to the indai sentence, the entirety of the ryakudai sentence (the noun predicate) is new information. This type of が is the same type that appears in subordinate clauses. You can think of this sentences as one subordinate clause + da. 


# Adjectival Sentences

A sentence with an adjective as its predicate is an adjectival sentence. Most adjectival sentences use は to mark its subject/topic. Think of は as the default particle to mark the subject/topic in adjectival sentences. Adjectival sentences sometimes don't have a topic.

Adjectival sentences function like nominal sentences. That is, the principle of new/old information, inversion, and ryakudai still work.

However, adjectival sentences also have two other usages of が called neutral-description ga. Neutral-description が can't be used with nominal sentences, but it is commonly used in adjectival sentences and verbal sentences.

The following sections will discuss reasons why が could mark a subject instead of は in adjectival sentences.

## Implied Topic in Adjectival Sentences

Before we discuss the two additional usages of が in adjectival sentences, I just want to point out that adjectival sentences make use of implying the topic (ryakudai) very often, more than nominal sentences. It is easy to confuse this usage of が with the next usage we'll cover. Here's an example of ryakudai with an adjectival sentence. A native Japanese speaker hears you speak and says,

nihongo が jouzu desu ne

Here, the implied topic is anata, as in "(Anata ha) nihongo が jouzu desu ne."

## Neutral-description Ga: Sentences with No Topic

Tsuki ha kirei desu

Tsuki が kirei desu

The first sentence here is a subjective judgment on the nature of the moon--that it is beautiful. The topic tsuki is old information and the predicate kirei is new information.

The second statement has no topic and it uses neutral-description ga. When neutral-description が marks a subject, the nuance of the sentence is that you are making an objective description (not a subjective judgment), and that what you are describing is temporary or changing. An simpler way to put it is that you should use neutral-description が when you're seeing something with your own eyes and you want to express what you see neutrally. 

If neutral-description が marks the subject in a adjectival sentence, the **entire sentence**, not just the subject, is new information.

It's much less common to see neutral-description が in adjectival sentences than the regular wa.

comment indigo: 7aedff 8290ff

object blue: 8ea7ff 72e7ff ffbb72

modifier yellow: ffff70

subordinate blue: b2ffff



# Verbal Sentences

A sentence with a verb as its predicate is a verbal sentence. Verbal sentences have a tendency to use neutral-description が to mark its subject. Think of が as the default particle to mark the subject in verbal sentences. Verbal sentences often don't have a topic.

The principle of new information functions differently in verbal sentences from how it does in nominal sentences. It is important to note that if neutral-description が marks the subject in a verbal sentence, the **entire sentence**, not just the subject, is new information. This is the same as how neutral-description が works in adjectival sentences. But unlike in adjectival sentences, neutral-description が is much, much more common in verbal sentences.

# が as an Object Marker

が can be used to mark an object too, but only with stative-transitive verbs. A more or less exhaustive list of these verbs is: aru (to have), dekiru, iru (to need), kikoeru, mieru, wakaru, -tai form, and the potential form. 

//

Learners sometimes make the mistake of marking an object with が when the verb that follows is not a stative-transitive verb. The particle used in this case should always be は or を.

//

Confusion between the Japanese particles は and が has plagued elementary Japanese learners for as long as they've existed. [It's like a curse upon starting learners everywhere that two of the most fundamental words in Japanese are also the easiest to ] Although native Japanese speakers are able to use these particles as easily as they breathe and can tell when someone has misused one in place of the other, most can only provide an explanation of the grammatical system behind them that is at best, an incomplete picture, and at worst, inaccurate. The usage of は and が can feasibly be taught through a few simple lessons, but for newcomers to Japanese and language learners in general, the comprehensive resources available can seem long-winded and daunting, especially if the explanation uses complicated linguistics terminology. This is why elementary Japanese textbooks opt for simple rules-of-thumb and offer explanations that may not be technically accurate. I don't necessarily disagree with this approach. は and が is best acquired through listening and reading to actual usage, as is true for most Japanese grammar points. It's important not to intimidate or confuse newcomers to Japanese right at the beginning of their learning journey. 

That being said, the simple explanations will eventually break down once the learner starts becoming overly aware of usages of は and が in the wild. They may suddenly notice a usage of ha that they feel が would fit into better and then find that they can't explain to themselves why one is used over the other. Poring over these small hangups while studying Japanese is not conducive to effectively learning the language. But given that ha and が are so fundamental to Japanese, I think it's understandable that a learner will eventually want to know a comprehensive model of は/が. In this article, I hope provide that model in the most simple terms possible. This article is not for beginners. I've written this article with intermediate and advanced learners in mind, as it serves little benefit to people who don't already have a basis of intuition with は and が.
