I have to credit Hisashi Noda (野田尚史) for his amazing research in this field. This guide heavily borrows concepts and examples from his published works 『 ｢は｣と ｢が｣』(1996) and 『文の構造と機能からみた日本語の主題』(1998), including his model for the nine sentence structures and their syntax. Unless explicitly mentioned, all examples I'll feature here will be examples from these two books. If you wish to go further into this topic, I recommend you [get your hands on a copy of 『 ｢は｣と ｢が｣』](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%80%8C%E3%81%AF%E3%80%8D%E3%81%A8%E3%80%8C%E3%81%8C%E3%80%8D-%E6%96%B0%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E6%96%87%E6%B3%95%E9%81%B8%E6%9B%B8-1-%E9%87%8E%E7%94%B0-%E5%B0%9A%E5%8F%B2/dp/487424128X).

All sentences in Japanese that use は or が can be categorized into one of nine structures, each represented by one of the following sentences.

1.  ｢父はこの本を買ってくれた。｣
2.  ｢象は鼻が長い。｣
3.  ｢かき料理は広島が本場だ。｣
4.  ｢辞書は新しいのがいい。｣
5.  ｢花が咲くのは7月ごろだ。｣
6.  ｢このにおいはガスが漏れてるよ。｣
7.  ｢富士山が見えるよ。｣
8.  ｢君が主役だ。｣

We'll call the first seven structures は structures because they all contain は. The last two structures will be called が structures, because they contain が but not は.

By familiarizing yourself with the prototypical sentence structures of Japanese grammar, my hope is that you'll be able to read a sentence and figure out **what** は or が is doing in that sentence. In part 2 of this series, you'll learn **why** one particle is used over the other, and how we can use that knowledge to choose between using は and が.

# The Primary Functions of は and が

## <a name="topic-wa" style="margin: 0; text-decoration: none;">Topic-marking は

The Japanese language has a special concept known as the **topic**. As the name implies, the topic in a sentence is something that sentence is broadly talking about. Sometimes, a topic can extend across the sentence and set the general theme for sentences that follow afterward. The topic in Japanese is marked by は. That means whatever comes immediately before は becomes a topic. Almost all sentences that have a topic marked by は in Japanese take the structure of:

> `Topic` + `は` + `Comment`

Whatever comes after は is known as a **comment**, which is just something we want to say about the topic. The comment is also sometimes called the **focus**.

## <a name="subject-ga" style="text-decoration: none;">Subject-marking が

A **subject** is one of two main components of a sentence, the other being the **predicate**. When the predicate is a verb, the subject is usually some kind of agent that does the action of the verb. When the predicate is a noun or adjective, the subject is being given a quality/attribute of that predicate, or being equated with it. As you may already know, the subject in Japanese is typically marked by が. A typical Japanese sentence without a topic may look like:

> `Subject` + `が` + `Predicate`

## <a name="topicalization" style="text-decoration: none;">Topicalization

As we just learned, は is commonly understood to be a topic marker. However, it is also very common for は to mark a **subject**. This is where confusion between は and が arises from. 

When は marks a subject, this does **not** mean the subject has ceased to be a subject and is now a topic. It's **both a topic and subject at the same time**. This is called **topicalization**: the subject has been topicalized because it is now marked by は. After some part of the sentence is topicalized, it is commonly placed at the front of the sentence.

The subject is not the only part of a sentence that は can topicalize. The most common parts to be topicalized are the **case markers**. You may already be familiar with all of them. There are nine: が, を, に, で, へ, と, から, より, and まで.

Unlike the case markers が and を, は is classified as a adverbial particle (*副助詞*). 

What sets が (and を) apart from other common case markers is that when は topicalizes something that is already marked by が (or を), が (or を) is dropped from it completely. In other words, you'll never hear <span style="color: #ff0040"> ｢×ここがは～｣</span> or <span style="color: #ff0040"> ｢×ここをは～｣</span>. に, で, and へ are also sometimes dropped.


| Case Marked Element + は      | Topicalized Result      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ここが   + は | <span style="color: #a5fc67">ここは</span> |
| ここを   + は | <span style="color: #a5fc67">ここは</span> |
| ここに   + は | ここには or <span style="color: #a5fc67">ここは</span> |
| ここで   + は | ここでは or <span style="color: #a5fc67">ここは</span> |
| ここへ   + は | ここへは or <span style="color: #a5fc67">ここは</span> |
| ここと   + は | こことは |
| ここから + は | ここからは |
| ここまで + は | ここまでは |

Subject-marking が exists on a different dimension of grammar than topic-marking は.[^1] That means the two structures of grammar we introduced often overlap, as you will soon see in the topicalization diagrams in the following sentence structure chapters.

[^1]: Noda proposes that topic-marking は exists on the lowest "situational mood layer", while subject-marking が exists on the highest "voice layer". Contrastive は and exclusive が exist between the two, on the "polarity layer" (as in affirmative/negative predicates).

# The Secondary Functions of は and が

## <a name="cwa" style="text-decoration: none;">Contrastive は

Contrastive は is a special usage of は that **contrasts** what it's marking with other things. When someone uses contrastive は, they're pointing out a difference about the topic with some other thing, whether that other thing is explicitly mentioned or not.

> 子供たちはカレー<u>は</u>作っているが、ごはん<u>は</u>まだ炊いていない。<br>*The kids are making curry, but the rice is not even cooked yet.*

The two underlined は in the example above are uses of contrastive は. This sentence contrasts the state of the curry (カレーは作っている) with the state of the rice (ごはんはまだ炊いていない). In general, when there are two or more は in a sentence, the first は may or may not be contrastive, and the は following the first は is likely to be contrastive.

> 子供たちはカレー<u>は</u>作っている。<br>*The kids are making curry, but...*

The example above is a sentence with one contrastive は. Even though the making of curry is not explicitly being compared against some other thing, the contrastive は here implies that there is some other thing that has not been cooked yet.

## <a name="xga" style="text-decoration: none;">Exclusive が

You may have also heard this form of が referred to before as exhaustive-listing が, or exhaustive が.

Exclusive が is a special usage of が that **emphasizes** what it's marking. The subject that exclusive が marks is singled out from a set of other possible things. Those other things may or may not be explicitly stated. In other words, everything else except for what exclusive が marks is **excluded** from consideration. 

> 大阪より神戸のほう<u>が</u>いい店がある。<br>*__Kobe__ has way better stores than Osaka.*

The sentence above clarifies that it's not Osaka, but Kobe that has better stores.

You'll learn more about exclusive が when we go over the [ ｢君が主役だ。｣ structure](#kimi).

## <a name="cwa-and-xga" style="text-decoration: none;">The Difference Between Contrastive は and Exclusive が

Learners are often confused about the difference between contrastive は and exclusive が when they are first introduced to the concept. This is understandable, since there are some circumstances where the two are interchangeable. However, the nuance between the two remains different. Consider the two following sentences:

> あいつ<u>が</u>許せない。<br>*__He__ is unforgivable.*

> あいつ<u>は</u>許せない。<br>*He is __unforgivable__.*

The English translations and the emphasized words are approximations of the sentence's nuance. The first sentence with exclusive が is a statement that specifies **who** is unforgivable out of all people, while the second sentence with contrastive は is a statement that specifies **whether or not** this person is unforgivable (because it's a negative contrastive は). Notice that exclusive が makes an implication about other people (that they are not the unforgivable ones), whereas this usage of contrastive は makes no implications about other people. 

Thus, contrastive は can't replace exclusive が in statements that specify something out of a pool of other things, as in:

> こいつよりあいつ<u>が</u>許せない。<br>*She's okay, but he's unforgiveable.*

> こいつではなくあいつ<u>が</u>許せない。<br>*He's the unforgiveable one, not her.*

Something else worth pointing out is that exclusive が can't mark objects, but contrastive は can.

> わたしはジュース<u>は</u>飲んだが、お酒は飲まなかった。<br>*I had juice, but no alcohol.*

> <span style="color: #ff0040">×わたしはお酒ではなくジュース<u>が</u>飲んだ。</span>

# <a name="hastructures" style="text-decoration: none;">は Structures

In this section, we will look at all of the possible structures sentences with は take when different parts of a sentence are topicalized.

| Structure | Topicalized Element |
|--|--|
| ｢父はこの本を買ってくれた。｣| Case-marked element |
| ｢象は鼻が長い。｣| Modifier of case-marked element |
| ｢かき料理は広島が本場だ。｣| Modifier of predicate |
| ｢辞書は新しいのがいい。｣| Demodified subject |
| ｢この問題は解くのが難しい。｣| Element inside clause |
| ｢花が咲くのは7月ごろだ。｣| Clause |

## <a name="chichi" style="text-decoration: none;">The ｢父はこの本を買ってくれた。｣ Structure

> 父はこの本を買ってくれた。<br>*My dad bought this book for me.*

The first structure we'll be learning about is the simplest of all the は structures. It's what we get when we topicalize a **case-marked word**.

The following diagram shows the topicalization of the subject 父 in the case structure  ｢父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと)｣. This leads to the sentence  ｢父はこの本を買ってくれた。｣

![Diagram showing topicalization of 父 in the case structure 父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと)](assets/img/chichi1.jpg)

The こと is here to represent that this part isn't being interpreted as a complete sentence, but as a precursor to the sentence.

Remember that は can also mark objects, which are generally marked by を. The object is topicalized, and は replaces を. Then, the topic is usually moved to the beginning of the sentence. Just like the subject, the object doesn't stop being an object when it's topicalized. The following diagram shows the topicalization of the object この本 in the case structure  ｢父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと)｣. This leads to the sentence  ｢この本は父が買ってくれた。｣

![Diagram showing topicalization of この本 in the case structure 父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと)](assets/img/chichi2.jpg)

Below are examples of sentences where elements marked with other cases markers are topicalized. Remember that when ｢〜に｣, ｢〜で｣, or ｢〜へ｣ are topicalized, they may become  ｢〜&#8288;は｣ instead of  ｢〜&#8288;には｣, ｢〜&#8288;では｣, or ｢〜&#8288;へは｣. This happens when ｢〜に｣, ｢〜で｣, or ｢〜へ｣ mark **location**.

>日本に温泉が多い(こと)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ Topicalization<br><u>日本には</u>温泉が多い。<br><u>日本は</u>温泉が多い。<br>*There are a lot of onsen in Japan.*

>弟に特技がある(こと)<br>↓ Topicalization<br><u>弟には</u>特技がある。<br><u>弟は</u>特技がある。<br>*My brother has a special skill.*

>｢<u>最近までは</u>プロレスラーだったんだ｣ とちびは言った。<br>*"I was a pro wrestler until recently," said the short one.*

><u>海へは</u>あっという間に着いた。<br>*We arrived at the beach in no time.*

>結局、それ以来<u>彼とは</u>会っていない。<br>*I haven't met with him since.*

>だが、<u>ヨーロッパでは</u>最近、ペアの両方の内側にダイヤを埋め込んだ既成品の結婚指輪が、一般にも売られるようになってきた。<br>*But in Europe, pairs of wedding rings with diamonds set in both rings have recently become available to the general public.*

>大きな<u>窓からは</u>日の光が差し込んでいる。<br>*Through the big window, a ray of sunlight cut into the room.*

Adverbs that express tense or extent (such as きょう, 今, その頃, いくらか, ほとんど, and 時々)  may also be topicalized.

><u>昨日は</u>花子が学校を休んでいた。<br>*Yesterday, Hanako didn't come to school.*

Some usages of ｢〜で｣, ｢〜へ｣, and ｢〜と｣ cannot be topicalized.

><span style="color: #ff0040">×<u>船では</u>, 暇がある学生が沖縄に行った。</span>

><span style="color: #ff0040">？<u>大島とは</u>このまえ僕がけんかしたよ。</span>

## <a name="zou" style="text-decoration: none;">The ｢象は鼻が長い。｣ Structure

> 象は鼻が長い。<br>*Elephants have long trunks.*

The sentence ｢象は鼻が長い。｣ is famous in discussions of Japanese grammar because of linguist Akira Mikami. In 1960, Mikami published『象ハ鼻ガ長イナア！』, in which he proposed that this sentence has no subject and advocated for the dismissal of the idea of the "subject" in Japanese. We'll subscribe to Mikami's interpretation of the sentence but keep the idea of the subject intact.

According to Mikami's view, ｢象は鼻が長い。｣ is a sentence formed from the case structure ｢象の鼻が長い(こと)｣ by topicalizing the modifier 象の. **Modifier** (修飾語) is a generic term for anything that modifies the meaning of something in the sentence. It can be an い-adjective, a な-adjective or something marked by ｢～の｣.[^2]  But in this structure, the modifier will always be a `noun` + `の`. 

Thus, the ｢象は鼻が長い。｣ structure is just another way of topicalizing a part of existing case structures. The noun being topicalized in this structure is **the modifier of a case-marked word**.

[^2]: There are other types of modifiers in Japanese, but I believe these are the only types that fit in our structures.

![Diagram showing topicalization of 象 in the case structure 象の鼻が長い(こと)](assets/img/zou.jpg)

Notice that the が in this structure is not exclusive が. We are simply stating that elephants "have long trunks," not specifying what part of elephants is long.

Another important thing to note about the ｢象は鼻が長い。｣ structure is that it's very common for the comment to express a **state** or **quality** of the topic instead of an **action**.

><u>わが国で栽培されるトマトは</u>、ホルモン剤を利用することを前提に栽培管理技術ができている。<br>*The cultivation techniques for tomatoes grown in our country were developed around hormone use.*

><u>仙台の県営球場は</u>グラウンドが荒れている。<br>*Sendai's prefectural baseball field is in bad condition.*

><u>大橋のシンボルともいえる主塔は</u>高さが海面から297m。<br>*The main tower, a symbol of Oohashi, stands 297 meters above the surface of the ocean.*

Sentences that derive from topicalization of the modifier ｢～の｣ in ｢～の～を...｣ can also be grouped into the ｢象は鼻が長い。｣ structure. These sentences take comments that express actions often.

><u>普通車は</u>、腰掛を主体として<u>車内設備を</u>変更した。<br>*The design of interior fittings in passenger vehicles, especially their seats, has changed over time.*

## <a name="kaki" style="text-decoration: none;">The ｢かき料理は広島が本場だ。｣ Structure

> かき料理は広島が本場だ。<br>*Hiroshima is the place for oyster cuisine.*

At first glance, this sentence seems to fit into the ｢象は鼻が長い。｣ structure we just saw because of the ｢～は～が...｣ pattern. However, we can't work backwards to find the untopicalized structure by just replacing ｢～は～が...｣ with ｢～の～が...｣like we did with ｢象は鼻が長い。｣

If we try anyway, we get <span style="color: #ff0040">｢かき料理の広島が本場(であること)｣</span>, which makes no sense.

 ｢かき料理は広島が本場だ。｣ is actually derived from <span style="color: #a5fc67">｢広島がかき料理の本場(であること)｣</span>. In this structure, the noun being topicalized is the **modifier of the predicate**. [^3] The predicate of this structure will always be a noun.

![Diagram showing topicalization of かき料理 in the case structure 広島がかき料理の本場(であること)](assets/img/kaki.jpg)

[^3]: I debated labeling the topic in this chart and the next one as "topic" instead of "topic/subject". Although it is technically possible to construe the topic in this structure as a subject, in practice this is irrelevant. In the model of generative grammar that Noda accepts, ｢かき料理は広島が本場だ。｣ passes through the stage ｢かき料理が広島が本場(であること)｣, and ｢辞書は新しいのがいい。｣ passes through the stage ｢辞書が新しいのがいい(こと)｣, but Noda says that these are highly unstable stages compared to the double subject stages in the other structures. They are awkward and you probably won't see them often.

The が in this structure is exclusive が. This is a major difference between this structure and the ｢象は鼻が長い。｣ structure. We're specifying that it's Hiroshima, not any other place like Sendai or Hamamatsu, that's famous for its oyster dishes. 

><u>雷の発生は</u>、雲の中に電気が蓄えられることが原因だ。<br>*Thunder forms when electricity builds up inside of clouds.*

><u>経営は</u>、冬の本土出荷インゲンが主体ね。<br>*Our business mainly involves shipping green beans off to the mainland during the winter.*

><u>あの芝居は</u>, こいつが主役だ。<br>*For that production, he's the lead actor.*

><u>商社は</u>人が財産。<br>*To corporations, people are capitol.*

>輸入攻勢もあるが、<u>消しゴムは</u>ほかの商品と違い、国産品が圧倒的に強いのが特徴だ。<br>*Of course there's overseas competition, but when it comes to erasers, Japan-made dominates the national market.*

## <a name="jisho" style="text-decoration: none;">The ｢辞書は新しいのがいい。｣ Structure

> 辞書は新しいのがいい。<br>*When it comes to dictionaries, the newer, the better.*

Here's another structure that fits into the ｢～は～が...｣ pattern. In the sentence ｢辞書は新しいのがいい。｣, the modifier is 新しい, and the noun that was topicalized is 辞書. To derive this sentence from its original case structure, we topicalize its **subject**, and the modifier of the subject becomes the subject in the new comment.

![Diagram showing topicalization of 辞書 in the case structure 新しい辞書がいい(こと)](assets/img/jisho.jpg)

There are two types of sentences that fall into this structure: the selective type and the parallel type.

### The Selective Type

 ｢辞書は新しいのがいい。｣ is an example of a selective-type sentence of this structure. The nuance here is that of all dictionaries, we select only the set of those that are new and say they're the best. We're specifying that we prefer new dictionaries, as opposed to old dictionaries, small dictionaries, blue dictionaries, etc. Thus, selective-type sentences of this structure use exclusive が. Here are some more examples of selective-type sentences:

> 温泉は、高台にある女性専用の露天風呂がお勧めだ。<br>*As for onsen, I recommend open-air womens' baths that are high up.*

> 同じ歳月成長した魚は、大きいものより小さいもののほうが"年輪"が詰まっていて、コリコリして甘いのだそうだ。<br>*If the fish are the same age, I've heard smaller fish have more growth rings than bigger fish, so they're much crunchier and sweeter.*

### The Parallel Type

The parallel type sentence of this structure, on the other hand, doesn't use exclusive が. These sentences start with the topic + は, followed by several clauses that contain が.

> 全国製麺連が調べた一人当り麺類消費量の全国平均は、うどんが年間1.9キロ、ラーメン類が2.8キロ、そばが0.6キロ。<br>*According to a survey by Zenmenren, the national average per capita annual consumption of noodles is 1.9 kilograms of udon, 2.8 kilograms of ramen, and 0.6 kilograms of soba.*

> 値段はLサイズが500円、Sサイスが300円だ。<br>*The large is 500 yen, and the small is 300 yen.*

## <a name="hana" style="text-decoration: none;">The ｢花が咲くのは7月ごろだ。｣ Structure

> 花が咲くのは7月ごろだ。<br>The flowers bloom in July.

What sets this structure apart from all the other ones we've seen so far is that the topic in this one is a **clause**.[^4]

[^4]: I introduce the definition of a clause in [Can the Clause Have a Topic?](wa-vs-ga-2/#subord).

![Diagram showing topicalization of 花が咲く in the case structure 7月ごろ花が咲く(こと)](assets/img/hana.jpg)

The function of this sentence is that the predicate (7月ごろ) is emphasized. It's the focus (comment) of our sentence.

The "Related to the Clause" part of the chart is usually some kind of word/phrase that expresses the reason or time for whatever is in the clause. It can also be a subject marked by が.

Notice that because we can't put は directly after 花が咲く, we have to nominalize the clause first with の. This also happens with the sentence ｢辞書は新しいのがいい。｣. Common nominalizers include の, もの, 人, and ところ.

><u>俳句が流行したのは</u>、そのためである。<br>*That is the reason why haikus became popular.*

><u>空席があっても客を入れないのは</u>、人手不足だからですよ。<br>*The reason nobody is being let in despite there being open seats is because we're understaffed.*

><u>フィリピンで終戦を迎えた竹内鉄男が復員してきたのは</u>、昭和二十一年だった。<br>*Takeuchi Tetsuo, who was in the Philippines when the war ended, was demobilized in 1946.*

><u>こんなに地球を悪くしているのは</u>、｢アメリカン・ドリーム｣ だ。<br>*The "American Dream" is killing the planet.*

## <a name="mondai" style="text-decoration: none;">The ｢この問題は解くのが難しい。｣ Structure



## <a name="nioi" style="text-decoration: none;">The ｢このにおいはガスが漏れてるよ。｣ Structure

> このにおいはガスが漏れてるよ。<br>*This smell must be coming from a gas leak.*

This structure is the rarest one of all we've seen so far. In fact, some linguists consider it ungrammatical. But as you will see later, these sentences have legitimate functions. This structure covers sentences like ｢このにおいはガスが漏れてるよ。｣ Even if we try to work backwards to uncover the case structure of this sentence, it makes little sense to accept <span style="color: #ff0040">×このにおいがガスが漏れている(こと)</span> as such.

We can't construct a topicalization chart for this one, so instead, here's a primer on the three major types of this structure you will encounter.

### The Redundant Type

Sometimes, we cannot reduce a sentence to its basic case marker structure because some portion of the sentence has been repeated before and after は, making it redundant. An example of this is:

> 500円硬貨の両替は、左側5番の機械で両替してください。<br>*To exchange 500 yen coins, please exchange them at machine number 5 to your left.*

The redundant portion of this sentence is 両替. This sentence is an overlapping of the two following sentences:

> 500円硬貨の両替は、左側5番の機械でしてください。<br>*To exchange 500 yen coins, please refer to machine number 5 to your left.*

> 500円硬貨は、左側5番の機械で両替してください。<br>*As for 500 yen coins, please exchange them at machine number 5 to your left.*

By repeating the redundant portion, we can tell that the speaker may have been trying to make their message clearer.

### The Omissive Type

Another reason we might not be able to reduce a sentence is because some portion of the sentence has been left out.

> いまのうちの会社のいいところは、雰囲気が自由なんですね。<br>*What's great about our company is it's easygoing.*

This sentence would be typical if we instead structured it like so:

> いまのうちの会社のいいところは、雰囲気が自由なことなんですね。<br>*What's great about our company is that it's easygoing.*

You might have heard of the so-called うなぎ文 before when discussing topic-marking は. 

>  ｢僕はうなぎだ。｣<br>*I'm having eel.*

The context is that someone says this in response when a waiter asks who ordered eel. It makes no sense to assume that 僕 is the subject of this sentence, because then the sentence would literally mean, "I am an eel." The sentence is an example of an ommisive type sentence of this structure. It is constructed by omitting を食べている from the end of the sentence.

> ｢僕はうなぎを食べている｣<br>*I'm having eel.*

This type of sentence occurs often in spoken Japanese. 

### The Inexact Type

Sentences with a predicate that don't semantically serve as an exact explanation of the topic fall into this category.

> 作り方は、材料を弱火で1時間ほど煮込みます。<br>*As for its recipe, simmer the ingredients on low heat for one hour.*

> 練習は、聞きだす回数を徐々に減らしていきましょう。<br>*As you practice more, try gradually reducing the amount of questions you ask.*

The topics in these examples, 作り方 and 練習, only serves as a rough "headline" for the entire sentence that follows it.

# が Structures

## <a name="fuji" style="text-decoration: none;">The ｢富士山が見えるよ。｣ Structure: Topicless Sentences

> 富士山が見えるよ。<br>*I can see Mount Fuji.*

The  ｢富士山が見えるよ。｣ structure is the only one we'll introduce that does not feature any sort of topic at all in its basic structure. Naturally, all sentences you'll see here will have **subject-marking が**.

![Diagram showing structure of  ｢富士山が見えるよ。｣](assets/img/fuji.jpg)

There are three broad categories that sentences of this structure fall under.

### Descriptions of Something Perceptible

A sentence fits into this category when it describes something that the speaker can directly see or percieve. These sentences appear often in spoken Japanese.

> 何か音が聞こえるわ。耳を澄ませて!<br>*I hear something. Listen closely!* - (村上春樹 『世界の終りとハードボイルド・ワンダーランド』 p.332)

Sentences that describe perceptible events that will happen very soon also fall into this category.

> いいか...今...血管がふさがる<br>*Listen... his veins will constrict soon...* - (新井素子 『...絶句(上)｣』p.407)

### Descriptions of Events

A sentence fits into this category when it describes an event that the speaker cannot directly see or percieve. This may be something that happened in the past or something that is happening right now the speaker can't percieve. These sentences appear often in written Japanese.

> きのう合格発表があった。<br>*The exam results were announced yesterday.*

### Descriptions of Consequences

A sentence fits into this category when it describes something that will happen if some other condition is fulfilled.

> ボタンを押すと、音が出る。<br>*A sound will play when you press the button.*

### Here's The Twist...

There is a caveat to this categorization system. **Just because a sentence fits into this structure, doesn't necessarily mean the subject will always be marked by が.** If some portion of the sentence has been topicalized, it will feature は (in which case, it will fit into one of the は structures). If the subject has been topicalized, が will be dropped completely and be replaced by topic-marking は. Also consider the cases where contrastive は is used.

We'll go over when to use a topic later in [Can the Clause Have a Topic?](wa-vs-ga-2/#subord) and [Is There a Topic?](wa-vs-ga-2/#toppres).

## <a name="kimi" style="text-decoration: none;">The ｢君が主役だ。｣ Structure: Inversion and Exclusive が

> 君が主役だ。<br>*You're the lead actor.*

The sentence  ｢君が主役だ。｣has no topic-marking は, but it'd be inaccurate to say that it has no topic. The topic here is actually the predicate, 主役. This is what we call an **inverted sentence**. This property of the sentence comes from the fact that it uses **exclusive が**, a different form of が from the subject-marking が we saw in the  ｢富士山が見えるよ。｣ structure. This sentence has the simplest possible structure for any sentence that uses exclusive が.

![Diagram showing topicalization of 主役 in 君が主役(であること)](assets/img/kimitop.jpg)

Remember that exclusive が functions as a way of **emphasizing** something. With this usage of が, whatever exclusive が marks is singled out from a set of other things. 

One way of interpreting the sentence  ｢君が主役だ。｣ is to think of it as coming from the sentence  ｢主役は君だ。｣ This process of reversing the order of the topic and the comment is known as **inversion**. 

![Diagram showing inversion of 主役は君だ。](assets/img/kimi.jpg)

A typical topic sentence takes the structure of 

> `Topic` + `は` + `Comment`

whereas the inversion of this topic sentence will take on the structure

> `Comment` + `Exclusive が` + `Topic`

You'll learn more about inverted sentences in [When to Use Inverted Sentences](wa-vs-ga-2/#specsup)
