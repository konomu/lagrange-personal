## <a name="sub-main" style="text-decoration: none;">Subordinate vs. Main Clauses

## <a name="judge-phen" style="text-decoration: none;">Judgment vs. Phenomenon Sentences

This principle decides whether or not the sentence contains a topic.

## <a name="old-new" style="text-decoration: none;">Old vs. New Information
