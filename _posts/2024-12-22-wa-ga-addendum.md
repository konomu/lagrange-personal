Since writing [は and が: An In-Depth Guide](wa-ga-basics), I've come to realize that there are some usages of が that are difficult to explain with the typology given by Noda (野田 1996). Technically, his sentence typology covers the sentences I will explain in this article, but they function distinctly from typical sentences you will see in their given categories. So I believe they deserve their own descriptions. I've never seen any of these sentence forms described in English-language Japanese-learning resources (save for a mention of breakdown sentences in Kuno's **The Structure of the Japanese Language**). All information that follows comes from 今田 (2010).

We will look at four sentence forms, all of which are topicless noun sentences, and all of which contain が. 

# Neutral-Description Noun Sentences (中立叙述型名詞述語文)

The "neutral-description sentences" are probably most strongly related to the typical topicless sentence structure as described by Noda. The term "neutral-description" refers to a usage of が that doesn't impart any special emphasis and it is mostly **equivalent to the [subject-marking が](wa-ga-basics#subj-ga)** I introduced in the main guide. Thus, the verb and adjective sentences given as examples of topicless sentences by Noda can also be called neutral-description sentences. But in this section, I will specifically be focusing on neutral-description **noun** sentences, as these are much rarer than their adjective or verb counterparts. 

I have yet to find an explanation of why noun sentences using neutral-description が are uncommon. Indeed, when we use が in a noun sentence with no further context, the interpretation of the sentence which uses exclusive が is usually the one the speaker means. 

>1\. 私が田中です。(Exclusive が)<br>***I** am Tanaka.*

>2\. ? 私が田中です。(Neutral-description が)<br>*? Look, I am Tanaka!*

Consider example 1, a noun sentence using exclusive が. We can imagine that this is a sentence spoken by Tanaka in response to someone asking "Who in this group is Tanaka?" Tanaka is specifying that **he** is Tanaka. This is the natural interpretation.

But if we were to interpret the same sentence using neutral-description が, as in example 2, it comes across as awkward. In [The Principle of Topic Presence](wa-ga-topic-presence), I explained the conditions under which a sentence is likey to be expressed as a topicless sentence (i.e. use neutral-description が). One of those conditions was that "a temporary state directly observable to the speaker, expressed at that moment," was being conveyed. Neutral-description が imparts a nuance that the sentence is describing some event, or something the speaker is percieving. Thus, this interpretation is unnatural unless we imagine a fantastical situation where the speaker has magically assumed Tanaka's body and is pointing it out (or something similar).

Nevertheless, neutral-description noun sentences are grammatical and will sound natural if the context allows for it. The following examples (3-9) all use neutral-description が.

>3\. あっ、<u>家が</u>ドーム型だ！<br>*Woah, the house is dome-shaped!*

>4\. あっ、<u>イチローが</u>四番打者だ！<br>*Hey look, Ichirou's batting fourth!*

>5\. <u>信号が</u>赤だ。<br>*The traffic light's red.*

Examples 3 to 5 are neutral-description noun sentences where what is being described is directly perceptible to the speaker. But as outlined in the introductory section on [Topicless Sentences](wa-ga-basics/topicless-sentences) in the main guide, there are other categories of topicless sentences which don't describe perceptible events/states. 


>6\. 日本チームの負けは濃厚だ。<u>主力選手が</u>ベンチウォーマーだ。<br>*The Japanese team is on the verge of defeat. Their best guy's on the bench.*

>7\. <u>上司が</u>あいつですよ。やる気が出ませんよ、まったく。<br>*My boss is that guy. I can't stand it.*

>8\. 彼女を信頼して全てをまかせたのだが、<u>これが</u>とんだペテン師だった。<br>*I put my trust in her and left it all in her hands, but she turned out to be a crook.*

>9\. 友人を家に泊めた。ところがその<u>男が</u>大酒のみだ。飲み始めたら止まらない。<br>*I let my friend stay at my house. But it turns out, he was a drunkard. Once he started drinking, he wouldn't stop.*

>10\. と、その時、ぼくの右手の下の布地が動く、ハッとした。ひょっとすると、<u>席の布地だとばかり思っていたところが</u>、彼女の。まさか。やっぱりそうだった。彼女のスカートだった。<br>*At that moment, the fabric under my right hand shifted, and I gasped. I thought I had my hand on the fabric of the seat... it couldn't be. But it was... my hand was on her skirt.*

Example 6 and 7 are neutral-description noun sentences which don't describe directly perceptible states, but temporary states occurring in the present. 

Examples 8 to 10 are neutral-description noun sentences which function like a description of a temporary state or event as experienced by the speaker. These examples are of recounted stories (events that happened in the past), so they demonstrate that neutral-description が isn't only used in statements narrated in the moment.


# Enumeration and Breakdown (項目の列挙・内訳)

が may be used to list items or to present a breakdown of data in a noun sentence. These sentences are a subcategory of the neutral-description noun sentences, so no nuance of exclusion is placed on any of the が used in them.

>11\. このチームは弱すぎる。<u>田中が</u>やっと10位だ。(Neutral-description が)<br>*This team is so weak. Tanaka's just barely inched his way into tenth place.*

## Examples of Sentences With Enumeration

>12\. 利益面でも<u>「減益は避けられない」が</u>二十四社、<u>「増収、生産性向上などで増益が可能」が</u>二十二社できっこう。<br>*As opposed to the 24 companies that say that "a decrease in profits is unavoidable," 22 companies say that "increasing profits is possible through improving yield and productivity."*

>13\. <u>チンパンジーが</u>先で<u>ヒトが</u>あとである。<br>*Chimpanzees came first, and humans came afterward.*

>14\. <u>上の子が</u>二歳三ヵ月、<u>下の子が</u>六ヶ月。<br>*My older kid is 2 years and 3 months old, and my younger kid is 6 months old.*

>15\. 正面のドアを入るとすぐ<u>右手が</u>リビングルーム、<u>隣が</u>寝室、<u>次が</u>ダイニングルーム。<br>*When you enter from the front door, the living room is to your right, the one after that is the bedroom, and then you have the dining room.*

>16\. <u>山田君が</u>受付、<u>田中さんが</u>司会、<u>佐藤君が</u>会計だ。<br>*Yamada is doing reception, Tanaka will be the presenter, and Satou will do the accounting.*

## Examples of Sentences With a Breakdown

>17\. 二十件のうち<u>十六件が</u>六十五歳以上のお年寄りだった。<br>*Of the 20 instances, 16 of them involved people over 65 years of age.*

>18\. 米国の貿易赤字は約千五百億ドルに達し、そのうち、約<u>半分が</u>対日貿易によるものだ。<br>*The US trade deficit is over $150 billion, of which about half is with Japan.*

>19\. 私のクラスでは、<u>五人が</u>男で、<u>六人が</u>女です。<br>*In my class, there are five boys, and six girls.*

>20\. <u>大部分の学生が</u>独身です。<br>*Most students are single.*

>21\. <u>ほとんどの学生が</u>金持ちの息子です。<br>*Almost all of the students are sons of affluent families.*

>22\. <u>老人の多くが</u>病身です。<br>*Many old people have fragile health.*

>23\. 日本人の三人に<u>一人が</u>近眼だ。<br>*One out of three Japanese are near-sighted.*

# Identificational Sentences (同定文)

Identificational sentences are noun sentences that use が to assign characteristics or special meanings to their predicate. They are distinct from both neutral-description sentences and inverted sentences. They may resemble inverted sentences, but there is no nuance of exclusion within them. Here are some examples:

>24\. 苦労してやっと手に入れたのがこれだ。<br>*This is what I have finally gotten my hands on after much hard work.*

>25\. 何でも反対するのが山田さんだ。<br>*Yamada is a guy who's quick to object to everything.*

>26\. 結婚し多少お金もたまると欲しくなるのが、家だ。<br>*A house is what everyone wants after they've gotten married and saved money.*

>27\. この問題を分かりやすく解説したのが、本書である。<br>*This book is what provides a clear explanation of this problem.*

If you have read through [How to Tell When Inversion is Possible](wa-ga-topic-position/#spec-sup), these sentences may be confusing to you. In that section, I introduced the rule that sentences with a referential topic should not be expressed as inverted sentences. But the examples above look like sentences with a referential topic which have been inverted. 

Indeed, the "uninverted" forms of the sentences are indistinguishable from typical topic sentences that cannot be inverted if you only look at the meaning of the subject or the predicate. But because they serve a different overall function from typical sentences with a referential topic, it is perfectly acceptable to express them in this way, with が. 

We don't consider identificational sentences to be inverted sentences.

The types of subjects that identificational sentences take are quite limited. In general, you will only see three types:

<ol type="a">
  <li>〜の Clauses (<b>何でも反対するの</b>が山田さんだ。)</li>
  <li>Noun-modifying Clauses (<b>何でも反対する人</b>が山田さんだ。)</li>
  <li>Clauses Expressing Roles (<b>反対派のリーダー</b>が山田さんだ。)</li>
</ol>

# Presentational Sentences (提示文)

Presentational sentences are a subcategory of identificational sentences.
