This is where I keep my personal website. It's Jekyll-generated and uses modified version of the [Lagrange theme by Paul Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange). Everything is still under construction for now. I'm working on adding more blog posts.

TODO:

- Add font support for Japanese text.
- Add Preview for stenoword deck

Possible articles:

- Mahjong font
- が vs. は
