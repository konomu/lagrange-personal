# Which Part is the Topic?

Once we have established that some sentence contains a topic, we move to the next stage of the flowchart. The principle of topic position decides **which part of the clause/sentence is the topic and where we should place it**.

The topic is what you are talking about, and the comment is something you are conveying about the topic. So when choosing what becomes the topic and what becomes the comment, we can follow the general rule that **the comment conveys one option among other options relating to the topic**.

### <a name="cwlc" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">Word-Level Considerations

Many rules besides this general one are useful for choosing the topic and comment. First, we'll take a look at one case that **must** become a comment.

| A noun will always be the comment if it is an:  |
| ------------------- |
| Interrogative Word (e.g. 誰, どれ, どこ, 何)|

This rule is the reason why you'll almost never see 誰, どれ, どこ, or 何 marked with は. If you do see an interrogative word with は, it'll always be contrastive は, not topical は, as is the case in (1).

>1\. <u>だれは</u><ruby>来<rp>(</rp><rt>き</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>て、<u>だれは</u><ruby>来<rp>(</rp><rt>こ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>なかったの？<br>*Who came, and who didn't?*

### <a name="cslc" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">Sentence-Level Considerations

The next set of rules I'll introduce aren't hard-set, but describe the general tendencies of topics in sentences. They can be summarized in the following table:

<table class="tg"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center;" class="tg-0pky"></th>

The rules for sentences with a **noun predicate** are somewhat self-explanatory according to our general rule. Words like 中心, 目的, 基盤, 限度, 値段, 年齢, 名前, and メニュー frequently become the topic, while their content becomes the comment. This is shown in examples (2) through (4).[^1]

[^1]: These sentences fit into the [｢かき料理は広島が本場だ。｣ structure](wa-ga-other/#kaki).

>2\. <u>アジア<ruby>人<rp>(</rp><rt>じん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby>食生活<rp>(</rp><rt>しょくせいかつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby>特徴<rp>(</rp><rt>とくちょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は</u>、<ruby>主食<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅしょく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>があることです。<br>*What's different about Asian diets is the abundance of staple foods.* 

>3\. <u><ruby>普通<rp>(</rp><rt>ふつう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>のコースターの<ruby>所要時間<rp>(</rp><rt>しょようじかん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は</u><ruby>約<rp>(</rp><rt>やく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>3分<rp>(</rp><rt>さんぷん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>ほどだ。<br>*Each ride lasts about 3 minutes.*

>4\. <u>このナタデココは</u>、ココナッツミルクを<ruby>静<rp>(</rp><rt>しず</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>かに<ruby>寝<rp>(</rp><rt>ね</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>かせて<ruby>発行<rp>(</rp><rt>はっこう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>させたもの。<br>*This nata de coco is made by fermenting coconut milk.*

"～というものは" is a phrase commonly used to give something a definition, and it can be shortened to "～とは". In (5), "炭焼きと(いうもの)" is topicalized, and the rest of the sentence explaining what it is serves as the comment.

>5\. <u><ruby>炭焼<rp>(</rp><rt>すみや</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>きとは</u>、<ruby>木材<rp>(</rp><rt>もくざい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>を<ruby>熱<rp>(</rp><rt>ねつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>分解<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんかい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>して、<ruby>揮発<rp>(</rp><rt>きはつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>しやすい<ruby>成分<rp>(</rp><rt>せいぶん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>を<ruby>可燃<rp>(</rp><rt>かねん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>性<rp>(</rp><rt>せい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>のガスとして<ruby>燃<rp>(</rp><rt>も</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>やしたり、<ruby>蒸発<rp>(</rp><rt>じょうはつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>にして<ruby>追<rp>(</rp><rt>お</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い<ruby>出<rp>(</rp><rt>だ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>したりした<ruby>後<rp>(</rp><rt>あと</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>、<ruby>炭素<rp>(</rp><rt>たんそ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>が<ruby>燃<rp>(</rp><rt>も</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>えてしまう<ruby>手前<rp>(</rp><rt>てまえ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>で<ruby>燃焼<rp>(</rp><rt>ねんしょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>を<ruby>止<rp>(</rp><rt>と</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>める<ruby>作業<rp>(</rp><rt>さぎょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>である。<br>*Sumiyaki is the process of pyrolyzing raw lumber to remove its volatile components to the point just before carbon starts burning away.*

For sentences with **adjective predicates**, we have two different rules. The first one covers adjective sentences that express some kind of comparison, which includes phrases like "～のほうが [adjective]" and "～がいちばん [adjective]". In this case, the adjective becomes the topic, and the noun subject is marked with exclusive が.

>6\. ｢でも、<u>リカさんと<ruby>一緒<rp>(</rp><rt>いっしょ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>にいる<ruby>永尾<rp>(</rp><rt>ながお</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>くんが</u>、私の<ruby>知<rp>(</rp><rt>し</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>ってる永尾くんの<ruby>中<rp>(</rp><rt>なか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>で<ruby>一番<rp>(</rp><rt>いちばん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>元気<rp>(</rp><rt>げんき</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>。｣<br>*"Nagao always looks the happiest when I see him with Rika."*

>7\. ｢お<ruby>茶<rp>(</rp><rt>ちゃ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>にする、お<ruby>酒<rp>(</rp><rt>さけ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>にする？｣<br>｢<u>お茶が</u>いい｣<br>*"Would you like tea or sake?"*<br>*"Tea, please."*

The second rule concerns adjective sentences that express no such comparison. These sentences will likely take the noun subject as its topic, marked by は.

>8\. <u><ruby>亭主関白<rt>ていしゅかんぱく</rt></ruby>の<ruby>家<rp>(</rp><rt>いえ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は</u><ruby>暗<rp>(</rp><rt>くら</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い。<br>*Households with domineering husbands are depressing.*

Sentences with **verb predicates** often have multiple case-marked nouns. The general rule with verb sentences is that whatever comes earliest in basic sentence order (subject-object-verb) becomes the topic. In (9), the subject (instead of the object) is the topic because it comes earlier in the SOV order.

>9\. その<ruby>頃<rp>(</rp><rt>ころ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>、<u><ruby>三郎<rp>(</rp><rt>さぶろう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は</u><ruby>刑務所<rp>(</rp><rt>けいむしょ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby>係長<rp>(</rp><rt>かかりちょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby>部屋<rp>(</rp><rt>へや</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>で<ruby>茶坊主<rt>ちゃぼうず</rt></ruby>をしていた。<br>*At that time, Saburou spent his days at the head of the jail's room, tending to his every need.*

The に case is typically expressed before the subject in sentences with predicate ある (as in ～に～がある), so ～に is topicalized in (10).

>10\. <u>｢アンチ<ruby>百恵<rp>(</rp><rt>ももえ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>｣としての<ruby>聖子<rp>(</rp><rt>せいこ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>には</u>、<ruby>百恵<rp>(</rp><rt>ももえ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>的<rp>(</rp><rt>てき</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>エロティシズムを<ruby>歌<rp>(</rp><rt>うた</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>わないという<ruby>宿命<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅくめい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>がありました。<br>*As the "anti-Momoe", Seiko was destined to never sing with Momoe-esque eroticism.*

### <a name="cclc" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">Context-Level Considerations

The concept of **familiar information**, as introduced in [Topic Sentences](#wa-ga-presence#topic-sentences), is also useful for determining the topic. Once again, this isn't a hard-set rule, just a broad tendency topic sentences have. 

Recall our definition for familiar information.

<table class="tg"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center;" class="tg-0lax"></th>
    <th class="tg-0lax">Definition</th>
    <th class="tg-0lax"><span style="white-space: nowrap;">Tends to Be...</span></th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;" class="tg-0lax">Familiar Information</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">- Anything present at the scene of the conversation.<br>- Anything previously mentioned.<br>- Anything related to something previously mentioned or present at the scene of the conversation.<br>- Anything the speaker knows the listener is aware of.</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">Topic</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
 
As mentioned in the table, familiar information tends to become the topic. Consider examples (11) and (12).

>11\. <u><ruby>俺<rp>(</rp><rt>おれ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は</u><ruby>中<rp>(</rp><rt>ちゅう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>卒<rp>(</rp><rt>そつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>さ。<br>*I'm a middle-school graduate, you see.*

>12\. <ruby>途中<rp>(</rp><rt>とちゅう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>に<ruby>西宮名塩<rt>にしのみやなじお</rt></ruby>がある。<u><ruby>同<rp>(</rp><rt>どう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>駅<rp>(</rp><rt>えき</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は</u><ruby>複線<rp>(</rp><rt>ふくせん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>電化<rp>(</rp><rt>でんか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>時<rp>(</rp><rt>じ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>に<ruby>名塩<rp>(</rp><rt>なじお</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby>各<rp>(</rp><rt>かく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>住宅団地<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅうたくだんち</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>のために<ruby>作<rp>(</rp><rt>つく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>られた。<br>*Nishinomiya-Najio is on the way there. The station of the same name was built when the line was electrified and double-tracked for the neighborhoods of Najio.*

In (11), "俺" (I) is topicalized as familiar information because it refers to the speaker, who is by definition present at the scene of the conversation. It's very common for first and second-person pronouns to be topicalized because the speaker and the listener are always going to exist in the context of the sentence.

In (12), "同駅" (the station of the same name) is topicalized because it is related to "西宮名塩" (Nishinomiya-Najio), a town which was mentioned in the previous sentence.

Some sentences violate this rule. In example (13), a specificational sentence, familiar information is marked by exclusive が, making it the comment.

>13\. しかし、<ruby>天気<rp>(</rp><rt>てんき</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は、<ruby>大気<rp>(</rp><rt>たいき</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby>循環<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅんかん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>というか、<ruby>気象<rp>(</rp><rt>きしょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>全体<rp>(</rp><rt>ぜんたい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>がカオスになっているため、<ruby>初期条件<rp>(</rp><rt>しょきじょうけん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>がほんの<ruby>少<rp>(</rp><rt>すこ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>し<ruby>変<rp>(</rp><rt>か</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>わると、<ruby>天候<rp>(</rp><rt>てんこう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>大<rp>(</rp><rt>だい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>異変<rp>(</rp><rt>いへん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>になってしまう。<u>これが</u><ruby>天気予報<rp>(</rp><rt>てんきよほう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby>当<rp>(</rp><rt>あ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>たらない<ruby>物理学<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶつりがく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>的<rp>(</rp><rt>てき</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>な<ruby>理由<rp>(</rp><rt>りゆう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>である。<br>*Weather isn't a set cycle, but a chaotic system, where even the slightest alteration in starting conditions can cause massive changes. That is the reason why weather forecasts are sometimes off.*

The reason why "これ" in (13) is marked with exclusive が is because the noun sentence rule we saw in [Sentence-level Considerations](#cslc) took precedence over the familiar information rule. In fact, it is very common for specificational sentences to express familiar information as its comment.

# <a name="where-placed" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">Where is the Topic Placed?

In typical sentences with a topic, the topic is placed at the front of the sentence, and the comment is placed after it. Recall chapter 1, when we saw the topicalization of "この本" (this book) in the case structure "父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと)".

>14\. <u>この<ruby>本<rp>(</rp><rt>ほん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></u><b>は</b><ruby>父<rp>(</rp><rt>ちち</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>が<ruby>買<rp>(</rp><rt>か</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>ってくれた。

Likewise, we can topicalize the clause "この本を買ってくれた" (bought this book for me) in the case structure "父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと)", so that it's placed at the front.[^5] The result is shown in (15). Notice that when we topicalize the verb predicate, it has to be **nominalized** first (made into a noun). We do this by adding a nominalizer like の, もの, こと, 人, ところ, or some other noun that the verb can modify. This is why の is added to the end of "この本を買ってくれた".

[^5]:This sentence fits into [the ｢花が咲くのは7月ごろだ。｣ structure](wa-ga-other#hana).

>15\. <u>この本を買ってくれたの</u><b>は</b>父だ。

[Inverting](wa-ga-basics/#spec-sentences) this sentence will then give us (16).

>16\. 父<b>が</b><u>この本を買ってくれたのだ</u>。

Thus, the usage of は/が changes depending on what part of the sentence the topic is in. If the topic is **before** the predicate, it is marked by は. If the topic **is** the predicate, the subject will be marked with exclusive が. Remember that sentences with the topic in the predicate like (16) are called **specificational sentences**.

Notice how (15) and (16) have **approximately the same meaning**. In many cases, a sentence and its inversion are interchangeable, but there are certain tendencies towards which version of the sentence is more likely to be expressed depending on context and what kinds of words are contained in it.

**Not all sentences with は will make sense when they're inverted.** For example, if we invert the basic topic sentence in (14), the result is highly unnatural. Before we go over when to use specificational sentences, we should learn how to recognize which sentences can be inverted and which ones can't.

# <a name="spec-sup" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">How to Tell When Inversion is Possible

First of all, if a sentence is specificational (i.e. uses exclusive が), it is already inverted, and we know for certain that it can be uninverted. 

For sentences with は, it may not be obvious if we can invert the sentence. To find out when it's possible to invert a basic topic sentence into a specificational sentence, we need to look at the meaning of its topic and comment. The topic is either **referential** or **predicative**. If the topic is referential, the comment is predicative; and if the comment is referential, then the topic is predicative.

|  | Definition | If Topicalized |
| :----: | ---- |
| Referential | Some individual object/concept | Sentence <b>cannot</b> be inverted |
| Predicative | Some aspect, category, role, or value<br>of the referential element | Sentence <b>can</b> be inverted |

Let's look at a sentence that can't be inverted. Consider sentence (17) and its inversion (18).

>17\. <u>ビルの<ruby>高<rp>(</rp><rt>たか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>さは</u>85mです。<br>*The height of the building is 85 meters.*<br><br>18\. <span style="color: #ff0040">×85mがビルの高さです。</span><br><span style="color: #ff0040">*85 meters is the building's height.*</span>

The topic in (17) and (18) is "ビルの高さ" (the height of the building), and the comment is "85m" (85 meters). "ビルの高さ" refers to the concept of the building's height, which is referential in this sentence. "85m" describes the value of the building's height, making it the predicative element of this sentence. In fact, nouns that express some kind of quantity are almost always predicative. As you can see in the table, **sentences where the referential element is topicalized cannot be inverted**, which is why (18) sounds awkward.

Now let's go back to our classic example ｢君が主役だ。｣. In this sentence, "君" (you) is the referential element, and "主役" (lead actor) is the predicative element because it is the "role" of "君." Since the predicative element is the topic, this sentence can be inverted.

>19\. <u><ruby>主役<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅやく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は</u><ruby>君<rp>(</rp><rt>きみ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>だ。<br>*The lead actor is you.*<br><br>20\. <u>君が</u>主役だ。<br>*You are the lead actor.*

If, however, we topicalize the referential element "君", it is no longer possible to invert the sentence.

>21\. <u>君は</u>主役だ。<br>*You are a lead actor.*<br><br>22\. <span style="color: #ff0040">×主役が君だ。</span><br><span style="color: #ff0040">*A lead actor is you.*</span>

In the example ｢その火事の原因は漏電だ。｣, the referential element is "漏電" (electrical fault) and the predicative element is "その火事の原因" (the cause of the fire). We can invert this sentence because the predicative element is topicalized.

>23\. <u>その<ruby>火事<rp>(</rp><rt>かじ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby>原因<rp>(</rp><rt>げんいん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は</u><ruby>漏電<rp>(</rp><rt>ろうでん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>だ。<br>*The cause of the fire is an electrical fault.*<br><br>24\. <u>漏電が</u>その火事の原因だ。<br>*An electrical fault is the cause of the fire.*

It makes little sense to topicalize the referential element “漏電” here, because in the context of this sentence, the cause of the fire is unknown. So neither (25) nor (26) are natural.

>25\. <span style="color: #ff0040">×漏電はその火事の原因だ。</span><br><span style="color: #ff0040">*The electrical fault is the cause of the fire.*</span><br><br>26\. <span style="color: #ff0040">×その火事の原因が漏電だ。</span><br><span style="color: #ff0040">*The cause of the fire is the electrical fault.*</span>

Adjectives and verbs are always predicative in this system. In other words, it's almost always possible to invert a sentence when an adjective or verb is the topic.

>27\. <u>いちばんいいのは</u>ダイヤだ。<br>*The best one is the diamond.*<br><br>28\. <u>ダイヤが</u>いちばんいい。<br>*The diamond is the best one.*

# <a name="when-to-invert" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">When to Use Specificational Sentences

When it comes to inversion, there are three types of sentences:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Sentences that <b>cannot</b> be inverted or expressed as specificational sentences</li>
  <li>Sentences that <b>can</b> be inverted and are <b>sometimes</b> expressed as specificational sentences</li>
  <li>Sentences that <b>can</b> be inverted and are <b>often</b> expressed as specificational sentences</li>
</ol> 

We just learned how to identify sentences that can't be inverted, which necessarily fall into category (a). Now, let's go over sentences in type (b) and (c).

| (b) Sometimes Specificational | (c) Often Specificational |
| ---- |
| - Sentences with a noun topic<br>- Sentences with a verb topic (nominalized or not)<br>- Sentences in which the comment is the <br>details of topics like 特徴 or 原因  | - Sentences with an adjective topic (nominalized or not)<br>- Sentences in which the comment is familiar information<br>- Sentences in which the comment is an interrogative word |

Example (23) falls into type (b) (sometimes specificational) because it has a noun topic, and its comment expresses the details of the topic "原因". You are more likely to see ｢その火事の原因は漏電だ。｣ than its inversion ｢漏電がその火事の原因だ。｣.

(29) also falls into type (b), because it has a (nominalized) verb topic. You are more likely to see ｢そう言ったのは山田だ。｣ than its inversion ｢山田がそう言ったのだ。｣.

>29\. <u>そう<ruby>言<rp>(</rp><rt>い</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>ったのは</u><ruby>山田<rp>(</rp><rt>やまだ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>だ。<br>*The person who said that was Yamada.*

In (30), the second sentence is type (c). 

>30\. ｢バリバリしゃぶりついてるじゃないの、いつもは。｣<br>｢<u>そう、しゃぶりつくのが</u>、<ruby>本当<rp>(</rp><rt>ほんとう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は<ruby>一番<rp>(</rp><rt>いちばん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>おいしいんだよ。｣<br>*"Why do you always suck on it like that?"<br>"It tastes better when you suck on it."*

Although its topic is a nominalized adjective, the sentence is expressed as an specificational sentence because its topic is nonetheless derived from an adjective. The last example in the previous section, (27), is also more commonly expressed as an specificational sentence (instead of (28)) because its topic is an adjective.

Sometimes, you'll have conflicting principles in the same sentence.

>31\. <u>これが</u>そばの<ruby>実<rp>(</rp><rt>み</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>です。<br>*This is buckwheat grain.*

In (31), the topic is a noun, but the comment "これ" refers to familiar information.[^4] In this case, the rule about familiar information is taking precedence, making it an specificational sentence of type (c). The uninverted ｢そばの実はこれです。｣ is also possible, but less common.

[^4]: This sentence violates the principle of topicalizing familiar information, like the example (16) in [Choosing the Topic: Context-level Considerations](#cclc)

>32\. <ruby>結局<rp>(</rp><rt>けっきょく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><u>どちらが</u><ruby>勝<rp>(</rp><rt>か</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>ったんですか？<br>*So, who won in the end?*

(32) has a nominalized verb predicate, but it also has an interrogative word as its comment. Here, the rule about interrogative words is taking precedence, making it an specificational sentence of type (c). The uninverted ｢結局勝ったのはどちらですか？｣ is also possible, but less common.
