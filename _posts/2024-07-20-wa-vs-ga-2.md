# <a name="flowchart" style="text-decoration: none;">The Flowchart Model

We can broadly categorize prior research findings about the Japanese topic into five main principles. 

1. Exclusive が vs. Contrastive は (三上章 1963, 久野章 1973)
2. Subordinate Clauses vs. Main Clauses (南不二男 1974)
3. Judgment Sentences vs. Phenomenon Sentences (三尾砂 1948)
4. Old Information vs. New Information (松下大三郎 1930) 
5. Specification vs. Supposition (三上章 1953)

Further research into the role of は and が in Japanese syntax structures has made it possible to construct a hierarchy of priorities each of these principles take when it comes to choosing between the two particles. We can use this hierarchy to construct a flowchart, but we'll have to change up these principles so that they play nice with each other.

| Foundational Research →    | New Principles     |
| -------------: | ------------- |
| Exclusive が vs. Contrastive は → | Principle of Emphasis |
| Subordinate Clauses vs. Main Clauses → | Principle of Subordination |
| Judgment Sentences vs. Phenomenon Sentences →<br> Old Information vs. New Information → | Principle of Topic Presence |
| Old Information vs. New Information →<br> Specification vs. Supposition → | Principle of Topic Position |

Here's the resulting flowchart:

![Flowchart](assets/img/flowchart.png)

The names of all of these new principles might sound daunting, but you can actually think of them as simple questions.

| New Principles   | Question     |
| -------------: | ------------- |
| Emphasis → | How is it Emphasized? |
| Subordination → | Can the Clause Have a Topic? |
| Topic Presence → | Is there a Topic? |
| Topic Position → | Which Part is the Topic and Where Is it Placed? |

We'll take a look at the rules that govern these principles in the following sections.

# A Simplified Flowchart

The following flowchart is an heavily simplified version that is adapted from the system above.[^2]

[^2]: It's just a coincidence that these two charts have roughly the same shape. Each node of the simplified chart doesn't correspond to the same node in the full chart.

![Simplified flowchart](assets/img/simple-flowchart.png)

Because of all of the shortcuts we've made here, I can't guarantee that this chart will always lead to the actual usage of は/が. This is partly because it doesn't account for some rules that you'll read about in the next sections, and partly because usage of は/が is **not entirely predictable**. Even in the full flowchart model, this is unavoidable, since it won't always be clear which path to take.

# <a name="emph" style="text-decoration: none;">How is it Emphasized?

The first step of our flowchart is the principle of emphasis. Its purpose is to catch the usages of exclusive が that don't mark any type of subject.

私はケーキセットにしよっと。p253

Exclusive が does not only mark subjects. It can mark certain usages of 「~に」,「~の」, and 「~で」 to make it

Exclusive が can appear in strongly subordinate clauses, but only those that lie on the tense layer (or lower). Thus, <br><span style="color: #ff0040">&nbsp;×「この賞がいちばん賞金が高くなる**まえ**は、応募者が少なかった。」</span><br>is incorrect, but<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;「この賞がいちばん賞金が高かった**とき**は、応募者が少なかった。」<br>is okay.

# <a name="subord" style="text-decoration: none;">Can the Clause Have a Topic?

This principle is also known as the principle of subordination. It decides **whether or not the marked element is able to be a topic**.

# <a name="toppres" style="text-decoration: none;">Is There a Topic?

This principle is also known as the principle of topic presence. It decides **whether or not the clause/sentence contains a topic**.

# <a name="toppos" style="text-decoration: none;">Which Part is the Topic?

This principle is also known as the principle of topic position. It decides **which part of the clause/sentence is the topic and where we should place it**.

In typical sentences with a topic, the topic is placed at the front of the sentence and the comment is placed after it. Recall back to Part 1 when we saw the topicalization of この本 in the clause 父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと).

> <u>この本</u><b>は</b>父が買ってくれた。

Likewise, we can topicalize the clause この本を買ってくれた in the clause 父がこの本を買ってくれた(こと), and we'll see that it's also placed at the front. This is the same structure as the one we saw for 「花が咲くのは7月ごろだ。」

> <u>この本を買ってくれたの</u><b>は</b>父だ。

[Inverting](kimi) this sentence will then give us

> 父<b>が</b><u>この本を買ってくれたのだ</u>。

which is the same structure as 「君が主役だ。」

Thus, usage of は/が changes depending on what part of the sentence the topic is in. If the topic is **before** the predicate, it is marked by は. If the topic **is** the predicate, the subject will be marked with exclusive が. From here on, we'll refer to these sentences with the topic in the predicate as **inverted sentences**.

Not all sentences make sense when they're inverted. Before we go over when to use inverted sentences, we should take a look at how to choose what becomes the topic and what becomes the comment.

## Choosing the Topic

The topic is something that you want to talk about, and the comment is something you want to convey about the topic. That means that when choosing what becomes the topic and what becomes the comment, we can follow the general rule that **the comment conveys one option among other options relating to the topic**. 

![Chart explaining the above rule with the example 父がこの本を買ってくれたのだ。](assets/img/topic.jpg)

### Word-level Considerations

There are many rules besides this general one that are useful for choosing the topic and comment. First, we'll take a look at one case which **must** become the comment.

| A noun will always be the comment if it is an:  |
| ------------------- |
| Interrogative Word (e.g. 誰, どれ, 何)|

This is the reason why you'll almost never see 誰, どれ, or 何 marked with は. If you do see it with は, it'll always be contrastive は, not topic-marking は.

> だれ<u>は</u>来て、だれ<u>は</u>来なかったの？<br>*Who came, and who didn't?*

In this section, I'll list some sentences with wrong usages of は/が that learners may mistake as correct.

それ[×が・○は]ありがたい。

きょう[×が・○は]寒いなあ。

きょう here functions like an adverb
