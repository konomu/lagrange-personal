A while back when I was working on a translation of a Mahjong textbook, I modified [an existing font (archived)](https://web.archive.org/web/20211103004509/https://dragon0549610.wixsite.com/tenhoublog/single-post/2018/03/16/%E9%BA%BB%E9%9B%80%E7%89%8C%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88) to match the style the inline tile diagrams in the book. It came out better than I expected, so I decided to release it so that anyone could use it. The tiles have a pink accent, and I think they look really nice!

The tiles map on directly to keys on the standard QWERTY keyboard. Honor tiles are

<div class="tile">qwertyuiopasdfghjkl;zxcvbnm,./1234567</div>

<div class="container" style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
    <div class="image"> <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/tilessvgbot.jpg" alt="rotated tiles" height="850px"/> </div>
</div>
