Notes: 

- Situations where what precedes ga is not the sentence's emphasis
 - When the entire sentence is emphasized (ganzen)
 - When the entire sentence is emphasized (not ganzen)
 - When the predicate is emphasized
- The focus of the sentence when ha is used is always in the predicate.
- The focus of the sentence when ga is used can be before ga, after ga, or the entire sentence.
- The presupposition of sentences with focus after ga is always a contrastive presupposition.
 - This is also true for sentences with focus before ga.
- Presupposition in sentences with ha aren't necessarily contrasted with other presuppositions.
