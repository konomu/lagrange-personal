# <a name="how-emph" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">How is it Emphasized?

The first step of our flowchart is the **principle of emphasis**. Its purpose in the flowchart is to catch the **usages of contrastive は and exclusive が that don't mark any type of subject or topic**. But in this section, we will discuss all sorts of usages of contrastive は and exclusive が.

It's possible to view both は and が as a spectrum. On the **spectrum of は**, we have topic-marking は on one end, and contrastive は on the other end. On the **spectrum of が**, we have subject-marking が on one end, and exclusive が on the other. Between topic-marking は and subject-marking が, we have a **spectrum of topicality**, indicating how topical the word is. Between contrastive は and exclusive が, we have a **spectrum of emphasis**, indicating in which way the word is emphasized.

![Spectra of は and が](assets/img/spectra.jpg)

The idea behind this model is that the two usages of は and the two usages of が we've introduced are not separate from each other. Every usage of は or が falls somewhere on the spectrum.

Generally speaking, there are three categories of は.

<ol type="a">
  <li>Topic-marking は with no contrastive nuance</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p>1. <u>父は</u>この本を買ってくれた。<br><em>My dad bought this book for me.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>Contrastive は which marks a topic</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p>2. <u>兄は</u>肉が好きだが、<u>弟は</u>魚が好きだ。<br><em>My brother likes meat, but my younger brother likes fish.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>Contrastive は which marks a non-topic</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p>3. 私は<u>肉は</u>好きだが、<u>魚は</u>好きではない。<br><em>I like meat, but I don't like fish.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</ol> 

In the flowchart, the "contrastive は" that comes after "Topic is Not the Predicate" refers to (b), while all other "contrastive は" on the chart refer to (c).

The same idea can be roughly applied to が.

<ol type="a" start="4">
  <li>Subject-marking が with no exclusive nuance</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p>4. <u>富士山が</u>見えるよ。<br><em>I can see Mount Fuji.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>Exclusive が which marks a subject</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p>5. <u>君が</u>主役だ。<br><em>You're the lead actor.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>Exclusive が which <b>subjectivises</b> a non-subject</li>
  <blockquote>
  <p>6. <u>六本木のディスコが</u>芸能人がよく来る。<br><em>Celebrities come to the discotheques in Roppongi often.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</ol> 

There is a crucial difference between (c) and (f) here. が has not fully evolved as an emphasis marker, so there is no usage where exclusive が is fully removed from its subject-marking function, unlike は, which can be fully removed from its topic-marking function. Some instances of exclusive が mark adverbs, clauses, or case-marked nouns other than the subject, but this is only true for those that have subject-like character. Thus, when exclusive が marks a non-subject, we may interpret that non-subject as having become a subject, a process known as **subjectivisation** (Kuno 1973). 

In the flowchart, the "exclusive が" after the "Principle of Emphasis" refers to (f). [^2] The "exclusive が" after the Principle of Topic Position refers to (e).

[^2]: In the simplified flowchart, all usages of は with contrastive nuance (b and c) are labeled contrastive は, and all usages of が with exclusive nuance (e and f) are labeled exclusive が.

# <a name="contrast-types" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">Types of Contrast

All usages of contrastive は have one of two forms of contrast: **explicit** or **implicit**.

||Definition|
|--|--|
|Explicit Contrast|What's being contrasted against is **explicitly mentioned**.|
|Implicit Contrast|What's being contrasted against is **not mentioned, only implied**.|

## Explicit Contrast

Explicit contrast occurs when two explicit things are being contrasted.

>7\. 子供たちはカレー<u>は</u>作っているが、ごはん<u>は</u>まだ炊いていない。<br>*The kids are making curry, but the rice is not even cooked yet.*

It often appears with multiple contrastive は, but it is possible with just one contrastive は as well. 

>8\. <u>形は</u>いいが、色が悪い。<br>*It has a nice shape, but that color is horrendous.*

Explicit contrast can be further divided into two types: **opposite** or **adjacent**. 

||Definition|
|--|--|
|Opposite Contrast|Shows that the state of one contrasted element is **opposite** to the state of another contrasted element.|
|Adjacent Contrast|Shows that the state of one contrasted element is **different**, but not opposite from the state of another contrasted element.|

In the following examples, (9) shows opposite contrast, and (10) shows adjacent contrast.

>9\. 私は<u>肉は</u>好きだが、<u>魚は</u>好きではない。<br>*I like eating meat, but I don't like fish.*

>10\. 私は<u>肉は</u>スーパーで買い、<u>魚は</u>市場で買う。<br>*I buy meat at the supermarket, but I buy fish at the street market.*

In sentences with opposite contrast, the predicates of the contrasted elements are usually positive and negative forms of the same predicate. They may also be predicates with opposite meanings. This is illustrated in example (9), with the predicates "好き" (like) and "好きではない" (don't like). In sentences with adjacent contrast, the predicates of the contrasted elements are similar but express some subtle differences. This is illustrated in example (10), where the predicates are both "買う" (buy), but the location where the food is bought is different. Opposite contrast is more common than adjacent contrast.

These usages of contrastive は are often connected with 〜が or 〜けど clauses. 

Both (9) and (10) show contrastive は marking objects, while the topic of the sentence is "私" (I). Thus, all usages of contrastive は in (9) and (10) don't mark a topic. But generally speaking, non-topical contrastive は is more common in sentences with opposite contrast than it is in ones with adjacent contrast.


### Misfortunate Contrast

This is a relatively minor usage of contrastive は that appears when something with negative connotations is being described. It is often followed by statements such as ｢困ったことだ｣, or ｢いけないことだ｣.

>11\. <u>家は</u>取られ、<u>妻には</u>逃げられた。<br>*They took my house, and my wife left me.<br>*

>12\. ｢<u>出席日数は</u>足りないし、レポートも提出していないし、受験も受けていない。｣<br>*"My attendence is too low, I never turned in a report, and I didn't even take the final."*

### More Examples of Explicit Contrast

>13\. サブは<u>ゴルフは</u>やるが、<u>生活は</u>派手ではない。<br>*Sahb plays golf, but doesn't live a flashy life.*

>14\. ｢<u>風は</u>冷たいけど、ええ天気や。｣<br>*"The wind is cold, but it's nice out."*

Although there is only one instance of contrastive は in (14), it still has explicit contrast, because "風は冷たい" (the wind is cold) and "ええ天気" (nice weather) are approximately opposite in meaning. They are being explicitly contrasted.

>15\. <u>雨は</u>降っているが、<u>雪は</u>降っていない。<br>*It's raining, but not snowing.*

>16\. 私たちは<u>数十秒間イキを止めていることは</u>できますが、<u>心臓を止めておくことは</u>できません。<br>*We can hold our breaths for just under a minute, but we can't stop our heartbeat.*

>17\. みりんは、<u>魚には</u>煮崩れを防いで味をしめるため最初に入れ、<u>野菜には</u>ツヤを出し、やわらかくするため最後に入れる、というのも大切なポイントだ。<br>*Mirin should be added first to the fish so that it keeps its flavor and doesn't fall apart during boiling, and afterwards to the vegetables for softness, and to give them a nice finish.*

## Implicit Contrast

Implicit contrast occurs when something being contrasted against isn't explicitly mentioned, only implied.

>18\. 子供たちはカレー<u>は</u>作っている。<br>*The kids are making curry, but...*

In (18), even though the making of curry is not explicitly being compared against something else, the contrastive は here implies that there is some other thing that hasn't been cooked yet.

Implicit contrastive は can be identified through the following properties.

|Implicit contrastive は tends to..|
|--|
| - Appear closer to the predicate <br> - Mark objects, 〜に elements, or adverbs, less often subjects <br> - Mark a noun with a counterpart that is easy to contrast with <br> - Be pronounced with a higher pitch along with what it marks |

The more of these properties a sentence has, the stronger its contrastive nuance becomes. Consider the following examples:

>19\. 私は<u>その質問には</u>答えられません。<br>20\. その質問には<u>私は</u>答えられません。<br>*I cannot answer that question.*

When there are two or more elements in a sentence marked by は, the one closer to the predicate takes on a more contrastive nuance. This happens because the emphasized portion of the sentence when contrastive は appears is not just the element marked by contrastive は, but also all of the content after the element until the end of its predicate. It is easier to pick up on contrastive nuance if the emphasized portion is uninterrupted. 

Thus, in example (19), it's natural to interpret that the speaker is clarifying that he cannot answer **that question** specifically. In (20), it's natural to interpret that the speaker is clarifying that **he**, specifically, cannot answer the question.

However, you may notice that in (19), the more contrastive は marks a 〜に element, while in (20), the more contrastive は marks a subject. As we know from the table above, contrastive は tends to mark objects, 〜に elements, or adverbs, instead of subjects. As a result, it is possible to interpret that there is almost no contrastive nuance in (20), but incredibly unnatural to interpret that there is no contrastive nuance in (19).

### More Examples of Implicit Contrast

>21\. こうしたなかで、<u>子宮がんだけは</u>年々確実に減っていく。<br>*Amidst all this, uterine cancer is the only cancer that is steadily decreasing year by year.*

>22\. 私は<u>みかんは</u>好きだ。<br>*I do enjoy oranges.*

>23\. 子供たちは<u>キャンプファイヤーは</u>しなかった。<br>*The kids didn't light a campfire.*


# <a name="contrast-neg" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">Contrastive は in Negative Statements

Implicit contrastive は is extremely common when the predicate is negative. These are predicates that end in ～じゃない, ～ていない, ～くない, ～ではない, ～じゃなくて, ～ません, ～ず, etc. For example, if we were to make the statement (24) negative, we would likely have to add contrastive は, as is shown in (25).

>24\. 日本の老人はシャワーでがまんできる。<br>*The elderly of Japan can tolerate showering.*

>25\. 日本の老人は<u>シャワーでは</u>がまんできん。<br>*The elderly of Japan can't stand showering.*

The reasoning for this is that a positive predicate is assumed to be the default state. When something is expressed to go against that default, we are **implicitly contrasting** it with something with the predicate's positive state. If we were to explicitly contrast the example above with this positive state, it would look like (26).

>26\. 日本の老人は入浴なら週2回でもがまんできるけど、<u>シャワーでは</u>がまんできん。<br>*The elderly of Japan can tolerate bathing maybe twice a week, but they can't stand showering.* 

However, we are not always strongly conscious of this implicitly contrasted state, and with some negative statements, it's not easy to imagine such contrast. 

>27\. 人間の麻薬には中毒がつきものだが、猫のマタタビには<u>中毒は</u>ない。<br>*Human drugs are addictive, but there is no addictiveness in silver vine for cats.*

In example (27), there is explicit contrast between "人間の麻薬には" (in human drugs) and "猫のマタタビには" (in silver vine for cats). However, it's hard to imagine some explicit state that can be contrasted with "中毒は" (addictiveness).

Thus, when contrastive は is used with negative statements, the nuance of contrast is often weaker than that of positive statements, or completely absent, as is the case in (27). 

You may also be familiar with the set phrase ではない/ではありません. The は in this phrase is also thought to be implicit contrastive は, but it has almost entirely lost its contrastive nuance.

### Negative Statements without Contrastive は

Some statements will not contain contrastive は even when it is negative. Such cases are listed below.

|Cases Where Negative Statements Don't Contain Contrastive は |
|--|
| - The inflected negative ending (e.g. 〜ない, 〜ません) of the predicate is strongly bound to its stem. <br> - The negative predicate is strongly bound to its subject. |

(28) and (29) are cases where the inflected ending is strongly bound to its stem.

>28\. <b>杉矢、ボー然としている。</b><br><b>杉矢</b>｢...<u>ホタルが</u>いない...｣<br>*<b>*Sugiya stares into the distance*</b><br><b>Sugiya:</b> "There aren't any fireflies..."*

>29\. ウイルスのプログラムは、単に行動形態がウイルスに似ているから、そう名付けられているだけで、あらかじめプログラムの上で決められた行動をする以外の何者でもない。そして、自然界に存在するウイルスと違って、人間が作ったものだということである。<u>この点が</u>、意外と知られていない。<br>*Computer viruses are named so simply because their behavior resembles that of a virus, but they are nothing more than programs that carry out predetermined actions. And unlike viruses that exist in nature, these viruses are man-made. This detail is, surprisingly, not widely known.*

(28) is a topicless sentence, while (29) is an inverted topic sentence. The ending ない seen in the predicate いる in (28) has a negating effect on the entirety of the word "いない", but unlike in negative statements with contrastive は, this effect does not extend to other words. "いない" may be viewed as one component separate from all other phrases, similarly to the word "不在" (absent). 

Look at the structure of ｢日本の老人はシャワーではがまんできない。｣

> ```日本の老人``` + ```は``` + (```シャワーでがまんできる``` + ```ない```)

The contrastive は is added as a result of ない acting upon the portion シャワーで. The structure of (28) is instead

> ```ホタル``` + ```が``` + (```いる``` + ```ない```)

(29) also follows the same principle, where contrastive は does not appear because ない is strongly bound to the predicate "知られている" (known). However, exclusive が is used here because "この点" (this detail) is the comment of the sentence. More details about the difference between topicless sentences and inverted topic sentences will be discussed in [Principle of Topic Presence](wa-ga-topic-presence).

The second case listed in the table, where the negative predicate is strongly bound to its subject, covers sentences like (30).

>30\. 野上は、学生の頃から、<u>女がいないことが</u>なかった...それも、いつも複数で...<br>*Nogami's never been without a girl, ever since we were students... and it's always been at least two at the same time...*

The portion "女がいない" (without a girl) takes が because it's a strongly subordinate clause (see [Can the Clause Have a Topic?](#subord)). The が after こと, however, is present because it belongs to the set phrase ことがない. Usually, you can tell that something is a set phrase if it appears as one entry in a dictionary. If it appears with が, it is less likely to be expressed with contrastive は.

# <a name="contrast-words" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">Types of Words Contrastive は Can Mark

Generally speaking, contrastive は can attach to all case-marked nouns (〜が, 〜を, 〜に, 〜で, 〜へ, 〜と, 〜から, 〜より, and 〜まで).

>31\. きょうは<u>パン屋へは</u>行かなかった。<br>*Today, I didn't go to the bread store.*

However, contrastive は cannot attach to the following cases:

|Contrastive は usually does NOT attach to|
|--|
|- 〜で expressing means (電車で), material (木で), or cause (かぜで)<br> - 〜から expressing cause (不手際から) |

(32) and (33) are ungrammatical, because contrastive は are attaching to words marked by で expressing means and cause.

>32\. <span style="color: #ff0040"> ×きょうは<u>電車では</u>来なかった。</span>

>33\. <span style="color: #ff0040"> ×きょうは<u>かぜでは</u>休まなかった。</span>

If the speaker is mentioning some condition instead of a matter of fact, however, then contrastive は can attach to these cases. 

>34\. 頂上までは、<u>車では</u>行けない。<br>*You can't get to the peak with a car.*

>35\. あいつは、<u>ちょっとしたかぜでは</u>休まない。<br>*He wouldn't take the day off just because of a cold.*

Now, let's take a look at which adverbs contrastive は can mark.

|Adverb Expresses...|Examples|Markable by は?|
|--|--|--|
| Manner | そっと, あっさり | × (○) |
| Extent | たいへん, 非常に | × |
| Aspect | もう, だんだん | × | 
| Tense | きのう, その時まで | ○ | 
| Mood | きっと, ぜひ | × | 
| Quantity | 3人, 100円, ちょっと | ○ | 

>36\. <span style="color: #ff0040"> ×これは<u>たいへんは</u>面白くない。</span>

>37\. <span style="color: #ff0040"> ×<u>もうは</u>着いていないと思う。</span>

>38\. <u>お昼ごろまでは</u>家にいた。<br>*I was at home until noon.*

>39\. <span style="color: #ff0040"> ×<u>きっとは</u>来ないと思う。</span>

>40\. <u>二百本は</u>売れない。<br>*Two hundred copies is too much for me to sell.*

>41\. <u>全部は</u>食べなかった。<br>*I didn't eat all of it.*

Generally speaking, the only adverbs that can be marked by は express tense or a quantity of something. In some cases, contrastive は can mark adverbs that express manner, but only when mentioning some condition instead of a matter of fact, similarly to (34) and (35).

>42\. <span style="color: #ff0040"> ×<u>そっとは</u>手渡さなかった。</span>

>43\. <u>そっとは</u>手渡せない。<br>*We can't hand it over without putting up a fight.*

Contrastive は may also mark 〜て appearing in successive phrases (See [Successive Phrases](/wa-ga-subordination/#successive-phrases)).

>44\. かすかな音を立てて降りそそぐ雨が、<u>睡蓮の葉に似た輪を描いては</u>消えて行く。<br>*The rain falls with a soft sound, making short-lived circles on the water like lily leaves.*

Contrastive は may also mark conditional clauses. When it marks 〜たら, 〜(れ)ば, or 〜と, the clause ending must change into 〜ては. When it marks 〜なら, the clause ending must change into 〜のでは.

>45\. 甘いものを食べても太らない人もいますし、<u>そんな子が無理に甘いものをガマンしてノイローゼになっては</u>、元も子もありません。<br>*There are people who don't gain weight even if they eat sweets, so I think it's counterproductive for her to resist them so hard if it just stresses her out.*

Finally, contrastive は may appear within a predicate. The predicates 聞いてはくれた, 愛しはする, おいしくはある, and 雨ではある are all examples of this case.

>46\. 女性は凡庸さに近いものを<u>愛しは</u>しますが、それだけのことです。<br>*Women love mediocre things sometimes, that's all.*

>47\. また、日本IBM製のパソコンでも、日本語モードを使っていれば<u>感染は</u>するが<u>発病は</u>しないのである。<br>*Using a computer from IBM Japan with a Japanese locale will not stop the virus from infecting your computer, but it will prevent it from delivering its payload.*

# <a name="exclusion-types" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">Types of Exclusion

All forms of exclusive が can have one of two forms of exclusion: strong or weak.

||Definition|
|--|--|
|Strong Exclusion|One option is picked out of a pool of other options to be marked by exclusive が, and those other options are **apparent**.|
|Weak Exclusion|One option is picked out of a pool of other options to be marked by exclusive が, but those other options are **not apparent**.|

While strong exclusion may be indicated by subjectivizing exclusive が (the one after "Principle of Emphasis" in the flowchart) or exclusive が marking a subject (the one after "Principle of Topic Position" in the flowchart), weak exclusion may only be indicated by exclusive が marking a subject.

## Strong Exclusion

Strong exclusion often takes the form of 〜のほうが... or 〜がいちばん... because these phrases directly imply the existence of other options that can be marked by exclusive が. The nuance of strongly exclusive が is that we are expressing a clear comparison between one thing marked by exclusive が versus some other thing(s).

>48\. 神戸より<u>大阪のほうが</u>にぎやかだ。<br>*Osaka is a much more livelier place than Kobe.*

>49\. あれも嫌い、これも嫌い、と否定を表明しつづける人より、<u>あれも好き、これも好き、と肯定を表明しつづける人のほうが</u>、なにごとによらず喜びは多い。<br>*People who are vocal about the things they love will always be more happy than people who are vocal about the things they hate.*

>50\. 一度帰ったら、なかなか出てこられないことは、<u>桃子が</u>一番よく知ってるでしょう？<br>*Out of all of us, Momoko knows better than anyone how hard it is to leave home after coming back.*

## Weak Exclusion

With weak exclusion, whatever is marked by exclusive が is still being singled out, but no clear comparison is drawn between it and some other thing(s).

>51\. <u>君が</u>主役だ。<br>*You're the lead actor.*

>52\. <u>一人ひとり違っているお客様の味を的確に読みとって、お好みどおりの飲み物を作って差し上げるのが</u>私たちバーテンダーの仕事なんですよ。<br>*Our job as bartenders is to pick up on the subtleties of our customers' preferences, and to make and serve drinks that they will enjoy.*

(51) and (52) are both inverted sentences. Sentences with weak exclusion will always be inverted sentences, but not all inverted sentences will exhibit weak exclusion.

Another case where weak exclusion appears is in commands where the subject is explicitly stated. It's rare for the subject to be mentioned in commands, so when it is, it's likely because the speaker is specifying who should carry out the command, adding exclusive nuance.

>53\. ｢どいて｣<br>と、桃子は、良介のショッピングカーをつついた。<br>｢<u>そっちが</u>どけや｣<br>*"Move," said Momoko, nudging Ryosuke's shopping cart.<br>"You move."*

# <a name="exclusion-words" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">Types of Words Exclusive が Can Mark

We already know that exclusive が can mark a subject, but there also exists another form of exclusive が called **subjectivizing exclusive が** that may mark non-subjects, turning them into subjects. This is the "exclusive が" that appears after the "Principle of Subordination" on the flowchart.

Unlike contrastive は, the set of case-marked nouns that subjectivizing exclusive が can mark is much more limited. For example, it may not mark objects.

>54\. わたしは<u>ジュースは</u>飲んだが、お酒は飲まなかった。<br>*I had juice, but no alcohol.*

>55\. <span style="color: #ff0040">×わたしはお酒ではなくジュースが飲んだ。</span>

The following table details the markers of case-marked nouns that subjectivizing exclusive が may replace. The original case particles must be deleted and replaced with が.

|Exclusive が can usually replace|
|--|
|- の expressing possession <br> - に expressing time, location, or direction <br> - で expressing location |

(56) is an example where の expressing possession has been replaced by subjectivizing exclusive が.

>56\. だが、現在はまだ<u>北の高気圧の方が</u>勢力が強い。<br>*But for the time being, the high-pressure system in the north is still the most severe.*

(57) is an example where に expressing location has been replaced by subjectivizing exclusive が.

>57\. 広島は<u><ruby><rb>流川</rb><rt>ながれかわ</rt></ruby>あたりが</u>バーや飲屋がおおいが、広島駅のすぐそばの<ruby><rb>駅西</rb><rt>えきにし</rt></ruby>の路地で飲んだ。<br>*In Hiroshima, there are many bars and drinking establishments around Nagarekawa, but we drank in an alley shop at Ekinishi, which is very close to Hiroshima Station.*

(58) is an example where に expressing direction has been replaced by subjectivizing exclusive が.

>58\. <u>六本木のディスコが</u>芸能人がよく来る。<br>*Celebrities come to the discotheques in Roppongi often.*

(59) is an example where で expressing location has been replaced by subjectivizing exclusive が.

>59\. <u>この店が</u>つけで買物できる。<br>*You can shop on credit here.*

The set of adverbs that subjectivizing exclusive が can mark is also narrower than that of contrastive は. Generally, only adverbs that express **tense**, such as 今 or ことし, may be marked.

>60\. 洗濯屋さんは<u>いまが</u>一年で一番忙しい。<br>*The cleaners are at their busiest at this time of year.*

# <a name="cwa-vs-xga" style="text-decoration: none; pointer-events: none;">Contrastive は and Exclusive が In Negative Statements

Consider the two following sentences:

>61\. <u>あいつが</u>許せない。<br>*__He__ is unforgivable.*

>62\. <u>あいつは</u>許せない。<br>*He is __unforgivable__.*

The English translations and the emphasized words are approximations of the sentence's nuance. The first sentence with exclusive が is a statement that specifies **who** is unforgivable out of all people, while the second sentence with contrastive は is a statement that specifies **whether or not** this person is unforgivable (as contrastive は in a negative statement). Notice that exclusive が makes an implication about other people (that they are not the unforgivable ones), whereas this usage of contrastive は makes no implications about other people. 

Thus, contrastive は is not interchangeable with exclusive が in statements that specify something out of a pool of other things, as in:

>63\. こいつより<u>あいつが</u>許せない。<br>*She's okay, but he's unforgiveable.*

>64\. こいつではなく<u>あいつが</u>許せない。<br>*He's the unforgiveable one, not her.*
